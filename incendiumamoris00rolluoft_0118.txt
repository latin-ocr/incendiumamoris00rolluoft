88 INTERNAL EVIDENCE

where the abridgment is careless, that a first person passage
is copied.

(2) Two are the only technically theological passages in
the book, one a discourse on the Trinity‚ another on the
Passion. 1

(3) Eight include exhortations to poverty and humility,
and warnings, “femine uitande sunt,'’ passages which
would seem eommonplace to a ‘fourteenth-century reader.2

(4) Five are passages on love as friendship« between God
and the soul,—rather characteristically Rolle, similar to his
“ What then is love? Love is a life, joining together the
lover and the loved‚’' in his Mending of Life.³

(5) Eight are digressions to side topics.
It is noticeable that in all except the last part of the short

text, its author was primarily interested in Rolle's views
on contemplation, and after omitting a passage, picked up
the thread again where Rolle uses words such as “Inuenitur

The short text is a much more con-eise treatise on contem-

nearer in form, for instance, to the works of S. Bonaventura
or the Victorines, than the long text, with its many
rambling autobiographical digressions. This suggests
that the author of the abridgment was a religious, and
probably not (like the hermit of Tanfield, one of Rolle's
followers) himself a solitary, in which case more of the
apologetic‚ autobiographical passages would probably
have been retained. The short text is just such a work as
a conventual religious, editing Rolle's “apologia pro uita
sua ” might have been expected to produce, if he were
interested in the teaching itself, but not particularly con-
cerned with the life of the teacher. There is evidence that
