F1Tz HUGH AND VADsTENA 99

Vadstena, in the presence of the honourable lady abbess
and of the reverend father, the confessor general of this
monastery, and of both convents, (that is to say, of men
and women,) attested by my spoken word, by the pledge
of my hands, and by the token of my helmet,1 I have
approved and sealed‚ and established for all time to come,
in the presence of the comrade of my Journey, sir Halneth

Mauleverer‚2 knight, and of my private chaplain, dom.

Peter.''

The other witnesses to the charter were the priests Katil-
bernus and Stephanus, with “ Eschillus et Laurentius
Romanus, claustri prouisores‚'' and “my beloved Olave
Botuidus, the Franciscan‚ Lector of Stockholm.’' To
further secure the chastes, the primate of Sweden‚ the
archbishop of Upsala‚ appended his seal.

The first brother sent to England to claim the fulfilment
of the charter made only a short stay, and died immediately
on his return. The Vadstena Diary states that shortly
before November 1, 1407, “Dominus Hemmingus, curatus
noster in Vadstena‚’' died in Jutland, in the city of Ripen.
The brothers had sent him to’ England, to see and accept a
certain monastery which was there to be built in honour of
S. Bridget.” 3 On 6 April, 1408, there is another entry‚
that “Two brothers of the monastery, namely br. John
Peterson, priest‚ and br. Katillus‚ deacon, were chosen by
the convent, and at their request crossed over to England‚
where a certain noble and devout knight promised the
brethren that he would build a monastery to the honour of
S. Saviour, His Holy Mother the Virgin Mary‚ and S.
Bridget‚ our blessed patroness.”4 The history of these

1. “Galeaeque meae signaculo.'’ Reference to the ceremony of the
delivery of the manor of Hinton ‘co the abbess, ‘⁴ viva voce,'’ with the
transfer of a boken. Fitz Hugh probably placed his hands between those
of the abbess, according to the form of the old oa‘th of fealty, and laid
upon the altar the erest, from his helmet.
