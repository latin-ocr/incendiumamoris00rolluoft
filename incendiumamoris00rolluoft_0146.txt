116 FOUNDATION OF SION ABBEY

with canonical procedure that one who had aspired to the
order of S. Saviour should return to the less strict
Benedictine rule. The difficulty was solved by the retire-
ment of Matilda to a reclusory at Barking in May,
1417.1 It is a coincidence that on August 8 of that
year, Henry V founded also a perpetual reclusory at the
sister-foundation, the Carthusian house of Bethlehem of
Sheen 2: the recluse was to have the same sum, 20 marks
yearly, paid to him by the prior and convent, that he might
be “the more free for orisons and divine praises and holy
contemplation ” ε 116 was to have two servants: the prior
was to repair the reclusory: and the grant ended with the
penalty by which the re-cluse might distrain the prior to pay
him the yearly 20 marks. The details in Matilda's case
are not given, as the grant was merely for life: but the
arrangements were probably the same. I have been unable
to find any reference to Matilda Newton before she became
a nun at Barking: the postulants to so large a house
probably came from any part of England where the abbey
held land, and her own relationship to John Newton, the
York treasurer‚ remains possible, but unproved.

The identity of William Alnwick, the confessor of Sion,
is as obscure and puzzling as that of Matilda Newton. The
Dictionasry of National Biography identifies him with the
William Alnwick‚ LL.D.‚ who was keeper of the Privy Seal
in 1423, made in 1426 bishop of Norwich and in 1436 bishop
of Lincoln. It states that he was an LL.D. of Cambridge,
a Benedictine of S. Albans, the confessor of Henry V and
Henry VI, appointed general confessor of Sion in 1415,
archdeacon of Sarum in 142O,3 and prior of Wymondham in
the same year3 he died in 1449, and was buried at Lincoln.
This account contains some difficulties ε it is unlikely that a
Benedictine of S. Albans should have been made keeper of
