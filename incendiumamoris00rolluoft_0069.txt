HAMPOLE 39

Of Rolle‘s life and wanderings‚ from the age of nineteen
till his death in 1349, little is known, except that his first
patron was Sir John Dalton, whose son had been Rolle’s
friend at Oxford, and that he passed the last years of his
life in a cell near the Cistercian Priory of Hampole, or
Hanepole. The present village, a few miles north of
Doncaster, lies at the bottom of a decidedly marked valley,
along the southern ridge of which passes the road from
Doncaster to Wakefield. The by-road to Hampole turns
off at right angles, and crosses the valley and the little
stream, by which the old Priory probably stood. The front
gable of the village school has some old stones built into it,
so that the peak of the roof now terminates in the empty
niche of a saint, and a rather squat and solid stone cross:
a probably mistaken local tradition regards these as having
been taken from the site of Rolle's cell. Two stones now
standing in a neighbouring cottage garden,1—the fretted
pendant of groined roos, and a monk’s head and shoulders
which once formed a corbel, are much more probably
remains of the Priory itself, of which even the exact site is
now unknown. Here Rolle passed the last years of his life,
and here probably he wrote the Incendizmm but of his
intermediate wanderings nothing is at present known.
Some passages in the Incendium seem to shew that he was
dependent, at different times, on different people for main-
tenance, but not that he was continuously wandering,
depending on the chance alms of those with whom he came
in contact. “ It is no shame to a hermit to change his cell‚”
he says, “though Ι am not speaking of wandering
monks‚ who are a scandal to hermits.‘' 2 He defends
himself vigorously in this book from the charge of
vagabondage, put forward by those who regarded the
recluse life as a perfectly normal social vocation. To
understand the point of view of his “ detractores,‘’ it should

Post Office gamem—collected when an old malt-house, into which they
had been built, was pulled down. 2. See p. 18372.
