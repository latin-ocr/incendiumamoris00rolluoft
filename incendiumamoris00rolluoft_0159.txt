THE FIRST PROFESSION 129

In the Swedish records the bull is followed by a statement
of the bishop of London that he inspected the bull, found
it genuine, and ordered its publication 28 January 142o;
and also by a note of the notary public who attested its
publication. The fulfilment of the instructions in this bull
must have occupied the year 1419, that between its issue
and the first profession of the postulant Brigittines at Sion.

The preparations were now complete, and the convent was
formally enclosed. “Anno domini MO CCCCOXX0 primo die
mensis aprilis celebrata erat prima professio ordinis sancti
Saluatoris de Sion in regno Anglie‚ per manus uenerabilis
patris domini Henrici Chycheley archiepiscopi. Quo die
professi erant uiginti septem sorores, quinque sacerdotes,
duo diaconi et quattuor fratres laici.”l From this day
dates the real foundation of the monastery. No· record of
the ceremony has been preserved either in bishop Clifford's
register at London, or in archbishop Chichele's own
register,2 nor is the confirmation of the election of the first
abbess and confessor in the year following. Bishop Clifford
of London, however, wrote to Henry V in 1421 as follows:
“On Sunday the fyft day of May, Ι was at youre hows of
Sion, and there confermed the eleccions of dame Jhone
North, abbesse, and of sire Thomas Fyschburne‚ my
welbelovyd cousin, confessour of youre seyd hows : and the
same daye I blessyd and stallyd the foreseyed abbesse ε the
which persones Ι truste, by Goddys grace, schal moch
profite in that place, in that holy company bothe of men
and of women, the whiche God of his mercy graunte.” 3

This ceremony completed the foundation of Sion abbey.
The next year the king transferred to Sion his manos of
Isleworth‚4 and in 1426 the duke of Bedford laid the founda-
tion stone of the permanent buildings of Sion, bestowing

certain classes of entries. The contemporary registers ab Ely contain more
casual information.
