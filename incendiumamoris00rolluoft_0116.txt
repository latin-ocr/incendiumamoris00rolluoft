The scribe generally omitted passages where, as here,

p. 198. [Omnis—triumphantes] Imperfectus.
pp. 198-9. [et ut hoc—subdunt] Si delecteris.
p. 200. [Corruptibilis—quia] dum terrena.

The short text has Item dum terrena.
pp. 200-1. [Ac nimirum—diligit] Quippe.

The scribe generally, as here, omitted passages where
Rolle speaks of “uerus amor,‘’ and describes more philo-
sophically than is usual with him, that he who “ rightly ”
loves God, loves Him only in any other thing which he

loves.
pp. 202-3. [Sed utrum—aperietur] Item quia . .

The first part of the passage is a digression, probably

omitted as such by the scribe.
pp. 203-4. [Unde—oraret] Dubitatur . . .

The scribe omitted Rolle’s list of Scriptural quotations to
shew the value of continual prayer. He copied again, when
Rolle turned to discuss the favourite mediaeval question, of
whether the active or contemplative life were more merit-
orius.

pp. 209—12. [Si sordes—putauit] In omnibus . . . .

The omitted passage deals with “uerus amor‚'’ and the
‘¹ dampnabilitas ” of the love of women. Both topics are
characteristic of Rolle, but were generally omitted by the
