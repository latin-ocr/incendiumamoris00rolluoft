66 LIFE OF NEWTON

general there; and when he was again translated to
Canterbury, he was succeeded at York‚ after a short interval,
by Scrope, who also made Newton vicar general on several
occasmns.

When appointed official at Ely, John Newton was
qualified for his legal duties by the degree of LL.D. He
had also been ordained acolyte and subdeacon by Arundel
at Ely, 1378,1 deacon by Arundel at London in 1379,2 and
priest by Arundel again at Ely a few weeks later.3 He
remained Arundel's official till the translation of the latter
to York in 1388, ancl was immediately appointed the official
of his successor at Ely, bishop John Fordham4 3 the register
contains correspondence between them on various matters.⁵

Newton had meanwhile, however, been appointed to the
mastership 6 of Peterhouse, Cambridge, during the episcopate
of Arundel : the bishop of Ely had the right to appoint as
master of this college one of the two nominees of the fellows.
Newton‘s appointment is not mentioned in the Ely register,
but one of the earliest existent compotus rolls of Peterhouse
speaks of the payment to him of forty shillings, his stipend

offices of vicar general and judge in the archiepiscopal court were some-
times united. When a vicar general was appointed, the bishop's official was
the most usual person to be selected, although the treasurer of the
Cathedral, or the bishop's chancellor, or any other ecclesiastic of sufficient
standing, might receive the appointment. The duties of the official, as
stated in the commission for the appointment of John Newton at Ely, were
to act as the bishop's representative in the consistory court, to decide
disputes arising under the bishop’s jurisdiction‚ punish offences against the
canon law, allow the probate of will and grant administration to exoeutors,
convene synods of the clergy, and “perform all that pertains to such an

office whether by law or custom . . . . even without special mandate ”3
