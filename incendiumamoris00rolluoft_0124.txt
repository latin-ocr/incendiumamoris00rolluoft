94 FOUNDATION OF SION ABBEY

the monastery of the new order which the King had just
founded at Sion.1

The foundation of Sion abbey in 1415, while the rule of
the nascent Brigittine order was still unconfirmed, explains
some of the private difficulties of the abbey, and most of
the obscurities and contradictions in the English records‚
with which this appendix deals. The difficulties were
however surmounted, and Sion remained till the Reforma-
tion one of the most p-rosperous of the English monasteries.2
It was one of the first of the larger houses to be dissolved‚
but the community has maintained a continuous existence
to the present day through the flight of the abbess and
sisters to the Low Countries‚ and their subsequent estab-
lishment by Philip ΙΙ. at Lisbon.3 Here they remained
till the nineteenth century, the community being recruited
throughout the period by English postulants. Among
other manuscripts and relics which the community preserved
throughout its flight and exile was the Mafrtiloge of Sion
monastery, a calendar with the names and dates of death
of the brothers and sisters filled into the appropriate days
of the month, and preceded by valuable memoranda con-
cerning the foundation of the abbey, lists of abbesses‚
confessors, benefactors, etc. When the community returned
to England theybrought with them this and other manu-
scripts, some of which they were forced to part with before
their final settlement at Syon Abbey, Chudleigh, Devon‚
where the sisters' convent remains to this day. The
Martiloge was acquired by the British Museum‚4 which
possesses also another manuscript,5 from which the daily
life at Sion can be studied as a supplement to the history of
the early years of the community given in the Martiloge.
