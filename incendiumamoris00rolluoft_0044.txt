facit sustinentes‚''=end of cap. 40 of Incendium. Newton
here adds: “ Require alia duo capitula alibi.”)

“ Tabula huius libri additur per magistrum Iohannem de
Neuton.'’ (A table of chapter headings follows, as in (n),
and as written separately before the chapters in (s) and
Misyn. The writing is that of the marginal notes to the
short text of the Incendium, which follows; and also of
the note on f. 99; it is careful and regular, and therefore
looks earlier than that of the text itself, which is rather
straggling. It is very similar to that of Newton's Regis-
ter at York. See Introd., pp. 64—79 and Index.)

Liber qui uocatur Incendium Amoris secundum Ricardum
Hampull.

Admirabar amplius quam enuncio. (The short text of
the Incendium follows, in the handwriting of the Oleum,

Indica me deus, and Mulierem fortem. The chapters are ν

marked and numbered in the margin by John Newton,
and he has written against passages omitted in the short
text, “ Require tale capitulum a sinistra parte ad tale
signum 0.’' “ Require alibi,'' etc., etc. Such passages
are usually found in ff. 25-58b.-—-roughly‚ chapters 6-40
of the long text of the Incendium; but chapters 12 and 15
are not in these folios‚ but among the passages (ff. 16-19)
often found after the comment on the Canticles; Newton
marked their absence in the short text with the direction :
“ Require capitulum duodecimum in tractatu qui dicitur
Oleum effusum,’' etc.; and he has marked them on ff.
16, 17, “ Capitulum duodecimum incendii amoris,’' “Capi-
tulum quintum decimum de incendio amoris.'’)

. . short text ends “saluus ero'' : but Newton has added

the remaining paragraph till . . . . “summo imperatori
in secula seculorum Amen '' (ie, the explicit of the long
text), and also: “ Hic correctus per librum quem sanctum

Ricardus de H. propria manu scripsit.‘' (As the “ book
in Rolle’s own hand ” does not now, probably, exist, this
note renders Newton’s notes authoritative for the text.
His emendations are, however, substantially the same as
the ordinary long text of the Incendium. Besides insert-
ing the omitted passages, sometimes in the margin, some-
times on a small interleaved folio, he has corrected most
