PREFACE ix.

manuscripts similar markings and monograms‚ and these
proved to have been made by Joan Sewell, a nun of Sion
abbey in the early sixteenth century. The inference
seemed to be that both the manuscripts which she thus
marked formed at that date part of the library of Sion3
especially as the markings referred to differences in the
text of the Incendium Amoris, and could only have been
made by a concurrent study of the two forms of the text,
such as the two manuscripts in question afforded. Since
one of the manuscripts thus marked by Joan Sewell, the
nun of Sion, was that previously annotated by John
Newton, it struck me as a coincidence that the first abbess
of Sion, nominated by Henry V the very year after
Newton’s death, should have been named Matilda
Newton. I wondered if this abbess were a relation of
John Newton’s, and if his annotated manuscript had
passed to her on his death. It would thus have become
part of the library of Sion, and accessible later to Joan
Sewell, whose monograms and markings it now contains
in addition to John Newton’s own notes. My effort to
ascertain the identity of Matilda Newton, made without
the light thrown on the subject by the late Dr. J. H.
Wylie’s recently published first volume of the Reign of
Henry V, led to the discovery of conflicting evidence
concerning the foundation of Sion abbey. This was
especially the case with that given by the foundation
· charter and Martiloge of Sion concerning the identity
of Matilda Newton, I found eventually that no relation·
ship could be proved between John and Matilda Newton,
that John Newton’s manuscript had reached Sion abbey
by quite another channel, and that the subject of the
foundation of Sion abbey became thus of only quite
indirect interest for the history of Newton's manuscript,
and that of the text of the Incendium Amoris. I have
nevertheless allowed it to form the final section of the
introduction, in the hope that it may be of independent
interest for the history of religious foundations in
