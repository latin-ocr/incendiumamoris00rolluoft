CONFERENCE AT SION 113

commend it,—you know how weak we are for immoderate
labours, and especially we sisters‚ who on account of the
many disadvantages of our frail sex cannot sustain any
heavy labours: let your fraternity then provide that these
constitutions, when they are confirmed, weigh not too
heavily upon us . . . . that they do not overp-ass the limits
of our frailty.‘' The letter ends by reminding brother
Thorvirus that the Vadstena sisters had sent to him certain
papers (quaterni), specifying the particulars which they
themselves wished to observe in the rule.l

The conference in January, 1416, was probably one of a
series of deliberations held by distinguished abbots to draw
up the “Additions” to the rule of Our Saviour which
should apply specifically to the English Brigittine houses.
At this conference, the petition of the sisters against the
performance of certain kinds of manual work, such as cook-
ing and baking, was refused: and the claim of the abbess
Matilda Newton to be obeyed by the confessor and brothers,
was also refused. The sequel is to be found in a Patent
Roll entry of May 17, 1417: “ Grant, at the supplication
of Matilda Newton, a recluse of Barkyng‚ to Robert Chud-
legh‚ William Crowmere, Henry Chaderton, Stephen Ingel-
field, John Lincoln and John de la Miere, clerk, of 20 marks
yearly for her natural life, at the hands of the sheriffs of
London‚ to her use.” 2 There is no reasonable doubt that
Matilda Newton, the abbess, and Matilda Newton, the
recluse, are the same: one of the trustees mentioned in the
grant, Henry Chaderton‚ is frequently mentioned in other
grants,3 as one of the trustees for Sion, and in one place, as
surveyor of the building works at Si0n4 zandapassage in the
Chronicon Rerum Gestarum in monasterio S. Albam: makes
the identity certain. The passage occurs in the description
of the year 1428, after an account of the wet harvest5 :
