VICARIATES UNDER SCROPE 71

York: Bottlesham succeeded him after a month or two,
and during his three years' mastership he too lived at York‚
and the two men acted as vicars general of archbishop
Scrope, whom they had known in earlier days at Ely. The
Section of Scrope’s register devoted to institutions and
inductions is headed “ Register of the vicars-general . . .
01 . . . Richard‚ archbishop· 01Υο1κῑ,”1 etc., and is dated
21 June, 1398. The first entry‚ dated 13 June, 1398, is the
record of the commission of the vicariate to John Newton,
treasurer,and John Bottlesham,chancellor‚ and is in the less
full form of Newton's first vicariate under Arundel. Three
entries follow in Bottlesham‘s name, and then a second and
fuller commission of the vicariate to Newton‚ conferring on
him special powers of presiding at the bishop's consistory
court, though not the power of collating to benefices. The
duty of presiding over the bishop‘s court in most dioceses
belonged expressly to his official: so that these special
powers were not expressly mentioned when Newton‚ as
Arundel's official, was appointed vicar general in his
absence; as he was now merely treasurer of the cathedral‚
they were granted to him in a special commission.2

1. 185, mentions that Fordham appointed Newton’s deputy, William
Cavendish, to succeed him on April 11 1397; but there is an entry, 27 Aug.
1397, that the fellows 01 Peterhouse presented to him John “Botkelsham '⁷
and William Irby for election to their mastership, and that Bottlesham
was appointed (ibid, 1. 189).
