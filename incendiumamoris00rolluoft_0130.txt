brothers between the years 1408 and the royal foundation
in 1415 is one of the puzzles of Sion history. Entries in
the diary shew that both of th'em remained in England.
“On October 4, 1416, br. John Peterson returned from
England‚ where he had remained for eight years in a
monastery of our Order.'’ 1 The record of his death, 30
December, 1418, states that “ he was one of the first to enter
