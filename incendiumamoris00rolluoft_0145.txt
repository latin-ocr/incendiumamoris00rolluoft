MATILDA NEWTON WITHDRAWS 115

As it stands, this passage is obviously an obituary notice
of Thomas Fishbourn, styled by the Martiloge the first
general confessor of Sion, who died at Sion abbey,
Isleworth, in September, 1428.l The S. Albans chronicler
is here giving a brief account of his life, occasioned by the
news of his death. He would be likely to be well informed
concerning Sion, because Fishbourn had formerly lived as
a recluse in the hermitage near the chapel of S. Germain’s
at S. Albans, because the sub-prior of S. Albans had been
one to assist in drawing up the Additz‘ones for Sion in
1416‚2 and because the abbot of S. Albans 3 was one of the
commission appointed by Martin V in 1418 to make further
arrangements concerning Sion, and admit the postulants to
profession. The passage is obscured in the Rolls Series
by a misreading which describes Matilda Newton as abbess
of the nuns of Barking, instead of simply “a nun of
Barking,'’ as it stands in the manuscript.4 “ In the time
of William Alnwick the first abbess of Sion, a nun of
Barking, was deprived of her dignity by the king, and
succeeded in that honour and enclosed state by a nun of
Markyate,’'-—Joan North, as we know from the Martiloge.⁵

The fate of Matilda Newton is thus clear—she had been
a nun at Barking‚ probably the largest nunnery in England
before the foundation of Sion, and one to which the two
Brigittine brothers in search of postulants might well have
applied. She was appointed as abbess of Sion by the king,
but she was not possessed of sufficient tact to guide the
heterogeneous community ⁶ at Twickenham in its struggle
to perfect its own organisation, and she was deprived of her
office by the king. It was not expedient that she should
return as a simple nun to Barking3 and though she had
as yet taken no fresh vows, it was hardly in accordance

election of Robert Bell, his successor, 30 Sept. 1428.

6. Her position with regard 'to the two fully professed Swedish sisters
sent, “for 'che instruction of the novices ⁷' must have been somewhat
anomalous; while her flock consisted of nuns from different, orders, and
the superior of the men’s convent, was an aged recluse. See p. 119.
