46 THE RECLUSE LIFE

writings: namely‚ that song shall burst from his lips, and
his prayers shall be sung with spiritual symphony and
heavenly sweetness.'‘1 The humble contemplative, he
says, shall be taught with wisdom from on high: “ But
those taught by wisdom acquired, not inshed, and those
swollen with folded arguments will disdain him, saying:
‘VVhere did he learn? Under what doctor did he sit‘? '
For they do not admit that the lovers of eternity are taught
by a doctor from within to speak more eloquently than they
themselves, who have learned from men, and studied all
the time for empty honours2 3 but these fools, who are
puffed up with acquired learning, not filled with the divine
wisdom, judge falsely of themselves.'' ³

The main purpose of the Incendium is the vindication of
the life of the hermit or solitary, not merely from the charge
of laziness and vagabondage, but of inferiority to the busy
and active prelate, or the devout monk. To do this, Rolle
quotes the example of John the Baptist, “ prince of hermits
after Christ,'‘ and of the north-country saint, Cuthbert, and
the Breton Maglorius. “The hermit life therefore is great,
if it be greatly led. For blessed Maglorius also, who was
full of miracles and rejoiced from his childhood in angelic
visitations, was made archbishop according to the prophecy
of blessed Sampson his predecessor. And when he was
warned by an angel who visited him, he put away the
archbishopric‚ and chose the hermit life, and at the end of
his life he was (divinely) warned of his death. So also
blessed Cuthbert passed from a bishopric to the life of an
anker. If therefore men like these acted thus to obtain
greater merit, what thinking man shall dare to set any state
in the church about the life of the solitary? '’

Rolle’s reference to S. Cuthbert is natural, for S. Cuth-
bert, whose shrine he might well have visited at Durham‚
was among the most popular of north-country saints. The
source of his reference to S. Maglorius is less obvious, for

the Breton saint can scarcely have been much venerated in
