ΤΕΧΤ OF THE INCENDIUM AMORIS.

Of man’s conversion to God, and the helps and
hindrances to his conversion

That no one attains quickly to supreme devotion,
nor is watered with the sweetness of contem-
plation

That every man who is called has his state
ordained by God -

The difference between God's lovers, and their
rewards

Why it is more needful to take heed to divine
love than to knowledge or disputation -

Concerning heretics, and saith in the T rinity -

T hat in things divine, we ought not to say three
Lords or three essenees, as we say three per-
sons ; and that a man shall be called great or
small according to the amount of his love

T hat the perfect lover of God had rather incur
great torment than even once offend God
through sing and why God afflicts the just with
the unjust - - · - -

That God should be praised and loved in adver-
sity; and about the mirth and humility of good
men - - - - - -
