CONFLICTING CLAIMS 111

spiritualibus praesint‚“ and Matilda “ut abbatissa loci
praedicti existat, ac eadem abbatissa et successores suae
monialibus sive sororibus praedictis praesint, ac regimen
universale monasterii praedicti, tam in spiritualibus quam
in temporalibus super se assumant, et ea faciant et exequan-
tur, quae ad abbatissam eiusdem lo-ci pertinent vel pertinere
quovismodo possint, eo quod huiusmodi confessor prae-
dictis viris religiosis in spiritualibus praesit, ut praedictum
est, dumtaxat excepto.’' The passage does not seem to
have been sufficiently explicit to ensure smooth working at
Twickenham : difficulties arose, and the abbess declared that
“ by the rule of S. Saviour‚ she was head of the monastery
in every particular, to be obeyed by the general confessor
and the brothers.’' 1 The whole sisters’ convent joined her
in the refusal which she made at the same time to obey the
Additiones, which prior Peter Olafson had added to S.
Bridget's rule, compiling them from the Revelationes
Extravagantes. These the Vadstena convent was appar-
ently inclined to accept. A manuscript in Upsala Univer-
sity library2 describes a conference held in England to
decide some of the vexed questions: “ predictus episco-
pus '' (Stephen Patringt0n‚3 bishop of S. David's), “ con-
fessor regis, abbates et maximi magistri Angue, presente rege
et conventibus utriusque sexus monasterii sancti Salvatoris
in Syon, et multis aliis monachis et clericis secularibus,
nullatenus prebuerent assensum, ut prius memorate sorores
a se dimitterent domos officiosas, braxaturam videlicet et
pistrinam et coquinam, sine requisicione, dispensacione et
speciali licencia pape.-—Hec determinata fuerunt in octaua
Epiphanie domine, anno eiusdem 1416.’‘ (13 January,
1416.)

These difficulties over the Additi'ones to the rule were not
confined to the English convent. In a correspondence

ἒ. {Zigae} p7'7.77·1t is noticeable that the postulant, Brigittines are here
spoken of as “two convents.’' The local Sion Additiones were first, drawn
up at this meeting, though revised later3 see pp. 122, 131.
