CONTRADICTORY RECORDS 109

ence shews that the Martiloge is substantially right, and the
foundation charter wrong, or misleading. In 1415, when
Henry V wished to endow the new monastery, there were
no English Brigittines in England: but it was necessary
for legal purposes that such a community should be created,
on paper at least, in order to deal with the large estates
which he was about to transfer. Matilda and Alnwick were
among those intending to enter the new order (although as
late as 1418 they had not actually left their old):l and
the legal mind solved the difficulty by describing these
postulants as professed Brigittines. The Martiloge is of
course right in giving the title of abbess and confessor only
to those who had been canonically elected by the whole
convent,—a procedure impossible in 1415, when there was
no convent to elect them.2 The foundation charter actually
provided that, “on the death or resignation of the said
abbess (Matilda)‚ the convent of the aforesaid place shall
have full and free power to elect another abbess in her
place.'' The omission of Matilda and Alnwick from the
Obit Book is due to the fact that neither of them died in the
order: Matilda, certainly, was never professed, and it is
most unlikely in the case of Alnwick.

Their withdrawal was connected with the general difficul-
ties οἱ the “new monastery of Sion.’' The foundation of
this monastery was no easy task‚ even for Henry V, and the
years between 1415 and 1420 were difficult ones for the little
community at Twickenham. To begin with, it was not
merely a new monastery, but a new order, which Henry V
was founding: no other Brigittine houses were actually
started in England, but this step was contemplated in 1415,
and provision was made in applying for the papal
confirmation for the foundation of Sion, that the grant
should apply also to any other Brigittine houses the king
might found in his realm.3 Long conferences were held

but there was no professed sister whom they could have elected as abbess.
