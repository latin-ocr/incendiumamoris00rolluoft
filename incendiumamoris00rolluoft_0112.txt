82 JOAN sEWELL

The originator of the monograms drawn so frequently by
sister Joan seems to have been a Carthusian monk of Sheen,
James Greenhalgh.1 It was the Brigittine custom that
postulants should pass the year in the noviciate in their
own homes, or in some house nearer to the abbey if these
were distant, coming at intervals to be instructed by a “ sad
and discreet sister.” It is possible that sister Joan became
acquainted with the Carthusian monk, who was a member
of “ House of Jesus of Bethlehem at Sheen,’‘ only a mile
away from Sion abbey, during this year of noviciate. He
at any rate presented her with a copy of Walter Hilton’s
Scala Perfectionis, in English, from the press of Wynkyn
de Worde.2 On the margins of the folio he had himself
made copious notes, and also frequently written his own

monogram, J.G. (Φ). Sister Joan, in imitation, wrote her

own monogram‚ J.S.‚ in the same manner, and also drew
an elaborate design, including the monogram, on a nearly
blank folio.3 The monogram in the design corresponds
exactly with those in the two manuscripts of the Incendium.
On another folio of the Scala Perfectiom's sister Joan wrote :
“ This boke belongyth to me, Jhone Sewell, Syster in Syon‚
professed in the yere of oure Salvation the thousand and
fyve hundreth. In die S. Vitalis martiris XXVIII Aprilis’‘ ;
and on other folios she apparently combined her own
monogram with that of James Greenhalgh who had given
her the book, writing J.G.S.,—for James Greenhalgh and
“Johanna Sewell.'' The monogram in the British Museum
manuscript (a), is also this combined one, though the order

is here J.S.G. (ᾗ). It is likely that (j), as well as

the Scala Perfectionz‘s, was given to sister Joan by James
Greenhalgh, since she twice wrote her name in it. The
British Museum manuscript perhaps belonged to the sisters‘
