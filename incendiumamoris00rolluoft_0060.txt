Admirabar amplius quam enuncio (the long text of the
Incendium follows. Another early hand has written in
the top margin: Incendium amoris, and a much later
hand has written, “ Ricardi Heremite de Hampole, nomen
scriptoris in fine legitur, f. 91b and f. 112b.'’ The writing
of the Incendium itself is irregular, pointed, and certainly
fourteenth century;1 it is in one column, 26 lines to a
page. There are no chapter-headings or annotations, and
initials, though coloured red, are very simple. Though
the MS. is undoubtedly early, it is unlikely that it 15
“the book in Rolle's own hand ’' mentioned by John
Newton. The conclusive argument against this is the
omission of a sentence in chapter 15 which all the other

long text MSS. contain (see p. 188 n), and of a few other

words in that chapter. The cramping of the writing also
on the last page but one of the Incendium (f. 91, which
suddenly has 42 instead of 27 lines to a page), suggests
that the scribe feared he should not be able to copy the
remainder of the Incendium on to that quaternus, rather
than that Rolle wrote the page himself. One would also
have expected to find Rolle's original manuscript of the
Incendium marked at chapter 15, “ Quomodo perueni ad
incendium amoris,'' a note in the first person frequently
found in other MSS. At the bottom of f. 33 is written
a very faint, small note, in a hand as early, and perhaps
the same, as that of the text : “ Incipit liber qui uocatur
Incendium amoris R.H.'' The Chapters are not num-
bered, but marked with capitals, and there is no division
into books. The text is, with very few variants, that of
(j) as corrected by Newton.)
