74 LIFE OF NEWTON

other wills of the period, containing either bequests of
books or of the right of purchasing them at his own priee.1
Newton made his own will on 4 May, 1414, and added a
codicil on 30 June, the will being proved on 13
July of that year.2 Both the will and codicil are very
long, and contain lists of bequests of books, vestments‚ plate
and household furniture. After a formal preface, and
directions for a funeral as simple as possible, comes a list
of 40 books bequeathed to the Chapter Library at York‚3
including the works of Isidore, Gregory, Boethius, S.
Bernard‚ etc., and “libros Johannis Howeden‚ Ricardi
Heremite, domini Walteri Hilton canonici, Willelmi
Remyngton et Hugonis de Institucione Noviciorum‚ in uno
volumine.’‘ “Richard the Hermit'' is, of course, Richard
Rolle: but the description of the book does not fit (j),
Newton’s emended text of the Incendium. Nor can it be
identified with any work now in the Cathedral Library at
York3 though it is just possible that Newton was here
referring to “the book which Richard H. wrote with his
own hand,” which he may have had bound up with the
works of Hoveden, Hilton, etc. The long bequest of books
to Peterhouse, Cambridge, already mentioned, is part of the
codicil to the will. Among the smaller bequests of the will

1. “Thomas Percehay of Swynton in Rydale” in 1391 left to him
“unum librum vocatum Petrum Blesanz,’' and “alium librum vocatum
Trevet, nondum plene scriptum· ..... et sciendum est quod in volumine
libri vocati Petri Blesanz, quam legavi, prefato Magistro Johanni de
Neuton, continentur in certis quaternis de Expositione Officii Episcopi,
ac commissione Beati Pauli, et Transfiguracione Domini, necnon de Exposi-
tione Beati Job, una cum 'Vita Beati Lazari3 quem librum integrum, una
cum aliis prenominatis, volo quod habeat Magister J ohannes prenominatusf’
The other will is that of John Harwood, advocate of the court of York.
He leaves tgo‘ ‘Domino meo specialissimo, Magistro Johanni de Neuton,
thesaurario? ‘one silver image, 0110111011οἀ, and one quire of paper ruled in
red according to the letters of the alphabet, called a ί’00115 11.’ Also I leave
to him the 0110100 of all my books. if he shall wish to buy any, and for a
price to be settled at his pleasuie. Also Ι leave to him a certain book of
Chronicles which our treasurer himself had bound in white.'’ He also left
to his clerk‘ ‘a green furred gown, of the livery of oui treasulffer '³ Test.
