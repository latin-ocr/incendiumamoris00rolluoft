IDENTITY OF ALNWICK 117

the Privy Seal, and it is unlikely that a man who in 1415
was considered capable 01 training in the contemplative life
a new monastery of a very strictly enclosed order should
have 1611 11 111 1420, 31161 become that active and energetic
prelate‚ the bishop 01 Lincoln.1 It is also unlikely that a
man who did not die till 1449 should have been considered
old enough in 1415 to be made the head 01 3 double
monastery. 13151101)ι Clifford's register in London contains
among the ordinations 01 secular candidates, 14 March,
1414, 11115 candidate: “Magister Willelmus Alnewyk‚ in
legibus bacallarius, rector ecclesie parochialis de Goldes-
burgh, Ebor. dioc.‚ per dimissoriam ad titulum beneficii sui,
etc.’‘ The candidate was ordained subdeacon, and I have
not been able to find his ordination to any higher order:
(either in Clifford's register,2 or in the bishop 01 Ely's
register at the period3 in 6356 Alnwick were ordained from
Cambridge. Nor does any mention 01 him occur in the
archbishop 01 York’s register, or in archbishop Chichele‘s
register.) It seems quite possible, however, that the
bachelor 01 law who was made subdeacon‚ as a secular‚ in
1414, should have become the “ king’s clerk ‘' and doctor
01 law 01 1116 Patent Rolls; but not that he should have
become 6011165501 01 Sion a year later. Dr. J. H. Wylie
mentions a canon William Alnwick, vicar 01 Chatton, who
was involved in the 6311 01 Northumberland's conspiracy
in 1408‚4 but in face 01 1116 entry in Clifford's register‚ the
identity seems doubtful.5 Another William Alnwick, who
may have caused the idea that the keeper 01 1116 privy 5631
was a Benedictine 01 S. Albans, is found at S. Albans in

1.Abbot Whethamstede‚ of S. Albans, cordially detested the bishop
of Norwich and Lincoln,—-cf. his very bad puns on William Alnwick⁷s name3
Chronicles and Memoriszls, no. 28, Iohannes Amundesltam, i, 364.

2. Which ends in 1420.

3. John Fordham's regisber exists from 1388-1412, so that the three
intermediate years before the foundation of Sion (1412-1415) are missing.

5. C.P.R.‚ 1413-16, p. 347; 1416-22, pp. 404, 406; 1422-9, pp. 118, etc„—
when he is referred to as keeper of the privy 5631. Hasd„ 1422-9‚ p. 226,
he 15 referred to as “ secretary and confessor of the· late king.''
