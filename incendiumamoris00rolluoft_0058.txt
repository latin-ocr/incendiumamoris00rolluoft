OTHER MANUS CRIPTS

(About half-way through book, opposite illustration of
gaily dressed man in elaborate head-dress, standing
between a furry devil with bat's wings and a monk in
white). Ne tardes conuerti ad dominum (i.e., Rolle’s
Emendacio uite. Besides the ordinary 12 Chapters, chap-
ters 13 and 14 are added : the work ends, apparently im-
perfectly, before a missing folio).

Melodia amoris (in later hand). Admirabar amplius
quam enuncio (the short text of the Incendium follows,
complete till chapter 32 ; the rest is missing, till almost the
few last lines of the short text which ends z) . . . . saluus
ero. Amen. Nam exuta a carne (a Latin sentence or two
of the scribe’s comment) . . . . Explicit tractatus com-
pilatus a Ricardo heremita qui uocatur incendium amoris
cuius anime propicietur deus. Amen. (This explicit is
not marked in red, although some parts of the text are,
for no special reason. This is probably the reason why
the sixteenth century scribe called the book Melodia
amoris, having missed the explicit.) Some remarks of
the scribe's follow : to the effect that hermits have greater
temptations than “alii labiles,'' and therefore a hermit or
anchorite should be apprehensive when not tempted, as
S. Gregory says ; and “resistere ualemus.'’

(Rubricz Incipit tractatus de hoc nomine ihesu com-
pilatus a Ricardo heremita.) Oleum effusum nomen tuum
. . . . Nomen ihesu uenit in mundum (i.e.‚ the Oleum
section of Rolle's Comment on the Canticles) . . . . ergo
sit nomen ihesu benedictum in secula seculorum. Amen.
Explicit tractatus de nomine ihesu compilatus a Ricardo
heremita.

In lecciones que ad suffragia mortuorum leguntur:
Parce mihi Domine . . . . (The last part is apparently
missing, the work ending, after Miserere mei heading,

. . seculorum gaudiorum carnales.'')

Vellum, 12in. by Sin„ with wooden covers, not foliated.
Straggling writing, in two columns. The first part of
the book is taken up by Grossetete's Dicta, followed by
a table of contents, and a note.1 Then follows
