THE RULE OF S. BRIDGET 93

to Boniface, though he was the true pope.‘’l The
canonisation was confirmed in 1415 by John ΧΧΙΙΙς2 but
as that pope was immediately afterwards deposed by the
council of Constance‚ the confirmation became invalid, or,
at least, insecure. The abbess and convent of Vadstena
continued their efforts to obtain a further confirmation,
urging their emissary at Constance to try to obtain one
from the new pope when the council should have procured
his election, and in 1418 writing to England to solicit the
influence of Henry V for that end. They suggested that
Henry and King Eric of Sweden should both use their
influence with the cardinals, and if possible persuade the
emperor Sigismund to join in their entreaties to the pope. 3
These efforts were successful ε Henry V petitioned4 Martin
V in that same year that whereas “the rule of SS. Mary
the Virgin and Bridget in Vadstena, of the order of S.
Augustine, called that of S. Saviour ’⁵ had been confirmed
by Urban VI “in the time of the pestiferous schism,“
Martin would now confirm it “to stop· the mouths of evil
speakers,'' and that he would also· confirm the canonisation
of S. Bridget‚ authorised by Boniface IX during the same
pestiferous schism. Eric of Sweden also addressed a peti-
tion to the pope on the same subject, and in answer Martin
V in ΙΨ issued at least four bulls⁵ dealing with S. Bridget
and her new order: two “ad perpetuam rei memoriam ''
announcing to the faithful his confirmation of her canonisa-
tion and her constitutions, and two addressed to Henry
V. Both the latter bulls announced the double confirma-
tion, and then dealt with particular matters connected with
