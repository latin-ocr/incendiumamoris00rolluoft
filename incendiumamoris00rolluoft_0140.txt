110 FOUNDATION OF SION ABBEY

between the most distinguished Benedictines, Cistercians,
etc„ in England‚ as to the rule of the new order which
Henry was introducing31 and the king had the additional
difficulty to encounter, that the rule of the whole Brigittine
order was still seeking confirmation from the pope whose
election had healed the Great Schism. This Brigittine rule
had been drawn up by Peter Olafson, S. Bridget's director,
from the book of her Revelations, and from the Revelationes
Extravagantes which he had himself compiled after her
death. The regulations‚ based on the Augustinian rule,
had been already in 1415 confirmed by the pope as
“ constitutiones ''; but Vadstena was anxious to obtain
their confirmation from Martin V, and in all the letters sent
from Vadstena to England‚ the king was besought to use
his influence with the pope, or with the cardinals, to obtain
this result.2 There was as yet no formally constituted rule
for the whole Brigittine order, on which the king and his
advisers could proceed.

There was also the second difficulty, of the double nature
of the new order, with all the minor complications which
this involved, and for which the English double order of
the Gilbertines seems to have been too local and temporary
to have afforded precedent. According to the rule of S.
Bridget, the abbess was the head of the whole monastery
in temporals, the confessor general in spirituals: but the
relations between them must have been necessarily rather
delicate, and in Henry’s new monastery at Twickenham,
the arrangement, at first, did not work. The foundation
charter ³ had specified that the men's and women's convents
should be separate, “distinctus per se,’' but that they
should be able and capable to hold land “sicut unum
monasterium incorporatum de quadam abbatissa et uno
conventu distincto per se '’; Alnwick was appointed
confessor, “ut ipse et successores sui viris religiosis in
