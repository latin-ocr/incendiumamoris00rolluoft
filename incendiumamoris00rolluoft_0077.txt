s MAGLORIUS 47

England. Rolle‘s words read as if he were acquainted
with the Vita S. Maglorii‚1 which relates how Maglorius,

bishop of Dol, was bidden by an angel “that he might seek
to offer ceaseless praises to the Lord‚ to go forth from hence,
and set forth to lead a solitary life in some desert spot.” 2
and how Maglorius then left his flock and “betook himself
to the desert, where he attained great holiness, and shone
with many miracles.''3 Actually, however, he seems to have
founded a monastery at Sark, and not, as Rolle implies, to
have lived as an anker or hermit. These two saints are the
only authorities quoted in the Incendium—an exceptional
feature in a mediaeval theological treatise.

·Alth0ugh Rolle’s estimare of the worthiness of the
solitary life is more mediaeval than modern, his estimate of
the asceticism which should accompany it is more modern
than mediaeval. His advice accords much more closely
with the dicta of modern psychologists than with that
usually given by mediaeval religious to those whom they
were instructing. “For he who would sing in the divine
love, or rejoice and burn in song, let him dwell in solitude.
and not in too great abstinence‚ nor let him give himself to
any superfluity. For it would be better for him in ignor-
ance to exceed the mean in a small matter, while he doeth
it with a good will to support nature, than to begin to flag
with too much fasting, and through bodily weakness have
not strength enough to sing. For the true lover of Christ,
and him taught by Christ, doth with as great zeal beware
of having too much, as of having too little.'’4 The pass-
age is similar in thought to that in the Prologue, where
Rolle says that the “outpouring of eternal love carne not
to him when testing at ease, nor when he was too fatigued
in body through walking, or even when he was beyond
measure occupied with worldly cares‚” and many other
passages.
