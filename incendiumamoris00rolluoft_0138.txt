108 ’ FOUNDATION OF SION ABBEY

request for papal permission for their exchange into the
Brigittine order, in 1418‚1 and a letter from Vadstena to
these postulants, which speaks of “your congregation,
gathered together from different orders, not yet united by
the same profession.''2 The congregation numbered at
least one recluse: for in March, 1416, bishop Stafford of
Exeter granted the petition of Margaret, recluse of Bodmin,
to transfer herself to the monastery of S. Bridget by Sheen. 3
Letters from Vadstena to Henry V, Fitz Hugh, and the
English monks intending to enter the Brigittine order, in
1418, speak of the “congregation’' as dwelling in the
“ new monastery'' of Sion, which Henry had built in
Twickenham, and shew that no English Brigittine had yet
been professed‚ and that the community was not as yet
formally constituted.4

The history of the persons whom Henry V named in the
foundation charter as first abbess and confessor of Sion is
interesting. There is the prima jacie difficulty of the
conflicting evidence of the foundation charter and the Sion
Martiloge: the charter speaks of their appointment as
abbess and confessor, as professed Brigittines,⁵ the
Martiloge knows nothing whatever about them. Not only
are Joan North and Thomas Fishbourn (actually elected
in 1421) described as first abbess and confessor respectively:
but Matilda Nevvton and Alnwick are not even mentioned
among the benefactors, or in the Obiit Book. Other evid-

of 110 evidence that Matilda was an enclosed recluse before her retire-
