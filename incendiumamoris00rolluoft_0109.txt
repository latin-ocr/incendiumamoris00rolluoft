NEWTON AND FITZ HUGH 79

battle of Humbledon‚ or Homildon Hill;l they must have
been brought into contact when Fitz Hugh was granted the
custody of the temporalities at York after the death of
Scrope;2 they were both in touch with the hospital of S.
Leonard's,3 York‚ to the mastership of which FitzHugh‘s
son succeeded;4 and they were both concerned in the
repairs to the fabric of York Cathedral.5 Newton was,
with William Wastham,6 the master of S. Leonard‘s, for
some time in charge of this restoration ; and when a serious
strike occurred among the masons› FitzHugh was one of
the commissioners appointed to try the offenders.7 An
interesting set of regulations⁸ for the masons was issued
in consequence by Newton and waltham, with the authority
of the cathedral chapter.

The relations of Newton and FitzHugh are interesting in
view of the later ownership of Newton's Incendium
manuscript, proved by a second set of marginal
notes. On f. 22, in the margin of Rolle's Judica
me deus, part of the text is marked with a line, and

the monogram J. S. ( ff ), while at the bottom of the page
is written in an early sixteenth century hand:

‘⁴ Sewella Syonita Reclusa.‘'
The previous folio has two monograms, J. G. and J. S.

6. Newton made William Waltham one of his executors and bequeathed
to S. Leonard’s “navem meam, vocatam barge.” Another of Newton's
executors, Thomas Haxey, the clerical proctor whom Arundel saved in
1397 from the consequences of his attack in parliament on the royal
household, was also engaged with Newton and Waltham on the restoration
of the cathedral. The chapter appointed him “ supervisor of the masons.”
