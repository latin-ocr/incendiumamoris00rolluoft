f. 66. Quomodo Ricardus Hampole peruenit ad incendium
amoris. Cum infeliciter florereml (zcap. 15 oi Incen-
dium.)

f. 61. . . . . ad detrahendum incitemini. Explicit Incendium
amoris.

Sermo beati Bernardi, etc. (On f. 18b, in the margin,
against the first of the passages which the short texts
omit [Ideo hoc audeo annunciare, cap. 5, p. 158], a line is
drawn, and the monogram J. G. S. occurs in the margin.
The monogram is a combined one, standing for Joanna
Sewell and James Greenhalgh [see Introd.‚ p. 82], and is
the work of Joanna Sewell, a Brigittine sister of Sion
Abbey‚ Isleworth. This MS. does not answer to the
description of any of the Hampole MSS. described in the
catalogue of the brothers' Library at Sion; but it may
possibly have belonged to the sisters' Library. Other
evidence makes it more likely, however, that, lik'e the
MS. of Hilton's Scala Persectionis, it was given to Sr.
Joan by Fr. James Greenhalgh‚ and was not used by her
simply as one oi the volumes in the library. It is inter-
esting to find that Sr. Joanna had also noted the difference
between the long and short texts of the Incendium.)
