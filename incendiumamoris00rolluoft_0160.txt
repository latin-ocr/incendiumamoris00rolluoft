130 FOUNDATION OF SION ABBEY

at the same time a gold ring on each sister 01 the first
profession. The first buildings had been situated in the
parish 01 Twickenham3 the second in the parish of Isle-
worth, on the site now occupied by the mansion 01 the duke
01 Northumberland, immediately opposite to Kew Gardens. 1
Hither the community removed, with much ceremony, and
accompanied by two archbishops and many bishops‚ in
1431, and here they remained till the dissolution. The
Martiloge itself seems to have been written about this date,
shortly after the removal 01 the convent to Isleworth‚ and
certainly in the time 01 Robert Bell, the successor to Fish-
bourn, and second confessor 01 Sion. The Additions to
the rule, which had caused such difficulties in 1415 and 1416,
were probably revised by Fishbourn‚ who wrote to
Vadstena for information on the subject on more than one ,
occasion.2 It is probable‚ however, that in their present
form, as embodied in the various MSS.³ from which
Aungier printed them in his history, they date from about
1431,——the period 01 the Martiloge. They are themselves
01 sufficient interest as furnishing details of the daily life
at Sion to give an excuse 101 an effort to investigate the
foundation 01 the community.
