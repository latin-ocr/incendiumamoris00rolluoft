64 THE LONG AND SHORT TEXTS

by the heading “Tabula huius libri additur per magistrum
Iohannem de Neuton.'' Newton probably compiled the
tabulal himself as a help to the emendation of his own
short text. He probably began the emendation by compil-
ing the table on loose paper‚ or parchment, and having
compared the two texts with its help and copied in the
missing portions‚ copied the table itself into his own
manuscript, leaving the loose table in “the book in Rolle’s
own hand‚‘' to become the source from which two other
long text manuscripts copied it.2

The John Newton who was thus the first to compare the
two texts of the Incendium was treasurer of York Cathedral
and a great book-collector of the late fourteenth century:
he died at York in 1414. His biography can be traced from
the compotus rolls of Peterhouse‚ Cambridge, the episcopal
registers at Ely, and the archiepiscopal registers at York.3
He was born, according to the letters dimissory 4
by which he was ordained‚ in the diocese, and
probably the city, of York‚ and though his paren-
tage⁵ cannot with certainty be proved, he was prob-
ably the son or grandson of a substantia] York mercer,

1. Newton bequeathed to his old college, Peterhouse, “libros Senecae et
Epistolas eiusdem in uno uolumine, tabulas eiusdem 111 quaternis”
Testamenta Eboracensiffiz 1, 364.

2. (n) and (f). See pp. 7, 20, 232n.

3. There are also printed references to him in one or two publicatione
of the Surtees Society, and a very few in the Calendar os Patent Rolls.

4. Req. Arzmdel, at Ely, f.125b; acolyte, “oriundus in dioc. Ebor.'’
subdeaoen, “per dimissoriam Arch. Ebor. ciuitatis sue originis.”

5. The earliest existent wills at the Probate Registry, York, date from
1389; but though Newton's father might have lived till after this date,
there is no sufficiently early will at the York Registry (see Wills in the
Yorlc Beyistry, 1389—1514, York. Arch. Assoe.), nor is there among the
wills of the Dean and Chapter at York (1321—1636). Neit-her the Patent
nor Close Rolls nor VVhittaker’s Εἰς hmondshire, nor Plantagenet Harrison's
History of Yor'kslmre, nor Glover's Izs irations, nor the publications of the
Surtees Society nor the Yorkshire Archaeological Association, supply any
clue to a Yorkshire family of Newton’s from whom he cah have been
descended. There 1s nothing to connect John Newton with the interesting
sub· sheriff of York, named John Newton, in 1355 (see 0011εῆ61- Book· of
Selby‚ ii, 44 York. Arch Assoc). Th'is John Newton was probably
the John Newton who was dep uty to Thomas Rokeby, sheriff of York, m
