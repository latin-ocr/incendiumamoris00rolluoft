102 FOUNDATION OF SION ABBEY

Cherry Hinton‚ much less to the existence of any community
there. At this date, the advowson of the living of Cherry
Hinton had just been confirmed to Peterhouse, Cambridge,
after a struggle with the bishop of Ely so prolonged that
the confirmation of the bishop of Ely, the two English
archbishops‚ the king and the pope himself had been
sought, when once Peterhouse had gained its point.l The
Peterhouse compotus rolls contain many references to
Cherry Hinton‚ both during and after the struggle, but
none to a Brigittine community there.2 This evidence is
inconclusive, but the absence of any reference in the Ely
episcopal register is almost decisive. Bishop John Ford-
ham’s register exists at Ely3 for the years 1408—12 (the
first four of the seven of the supposed Brigittine residence
there), but there is no entry relative to their establishment
there, nor are there any Brigittines, in the list of “religious”
candidates for ordination.

The evidence of the Patent Rolls is also against the exist-
ence of a community at Cherry Hinton. There is no licence
for Fitz Hugh to alienate the land in mortmain in 1406, or
later, and its absence is explained by a grant of Henry VI,
in 1444.4 This is a “ Grant in frankalmoign to the abbess
and convent of S. Saviour's, Sion, of the manor of Hinton
called ‘Uphalle’ in Cambridge, and all lands rents and
services late of Henry Fitz Hugh, lord of Ravensworth,
deceased, in Hinton‚ Great Wilbraham and Little Wil-
braham, co. Cambridge, which the said Henry granted to
Thomas, bishop of Durham‚ deceased, by the name of
Thomas Langley, and others, (as in Fitz Hugh‘s
Charter of 1406)—to the intent that they should grant the
same to the king, and that the king should grant the same
to the said abbess and convent, when the said monastery
should be founded . . . . and the said bishop demised the
