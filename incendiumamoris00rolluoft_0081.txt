THE DE TRIPLICI viA 51

the class of reader for whom he designs the book: it is
found in all the complete MSS. of his Incendium, both in
the long and short forms of the text.1 Miss Allen pointed
out, in her Authorship of the Prick of conscience, 2 that this
passage was printed in the older editions of the De Triplici
Via (the so-called Incendium Amoris), but there seems no
doubt that it is the work of the English, and not the Italian
mystic. It is indeed, so obviously foreign to Bonaventura
in matter and style, that some of his early critical editors,
perceiving this, rejected the whole work as spurious. The
Quaracchi editors, however, discriminated between the
Prologue and the body of the work, and while rejecting
the Prologue as of unknown authorship, print the so-called
Incendium Amoris among the genuine works of Bonaven-
tura, under its old title of De Triplici Via. Their conclusion
was based on the discovery that only three out of the 299
Bonaventura MSS. contain the passage‚3 while one of these
shews the transition stage at which it became incorporated,
and has the Prologue at the end, instead of the beginning
of the work.4

An Indulgence, written on the fly-leaf of a Cambridge
MS. of Rolle's incendium? suggests the council of
Constance as the possible medium by which the fusion
between Rolle and Bonaventura occurred, and there is no
chronological difficulty in accepting this theory, since the
Quaracchi editors class all the three “contaminated'’ MSS.
as belonging to the fifteenth century.6 The indulgence

1. Internal evidence also shews that the Prologue is Rolle's work. For
the dominant thoughts of the Prologue‚ that in contemplation an actual
heat is felt by the body, ef. p. 171, canentis cors, igne exuritur, p. 189,
flagrante sensibiliter calore; that bodily fatigue hinders contemplation, cf.
p. 174, inestimabile est hoc hominem percipere in corpore, p. 175,
earo . . . nimia fame aut itinere impediatur, p. 185, si hoino multum stet

. corpus fatigatur et sic impeditur anima, p. 236, corruptibilitas
corporis animam aggravans 3 that God is known by lovers and doers, not by
disputants and philosophers, cf. p. 160, procuremus pocius ut nos accendat

amor Christi, p. 194, non facientibus sed diligentibus est habundancia
celestis corone. 2. p. 133.
