42 CURRENT FASHIONS

the exuberant zeal of the writer saves the most rambling
passages and most frequently repeated thoughts from
dulness. The main idea of the book is simple: that the
solitary finds Him whom he loves with a rapture and
completeness which no other life affords, and that the
devotion offered by such a life to the “Omnipotens Amator’‘
is supreme, both as to merit and reward. “Magna est uita
heremitica, si magnifice agatur.’'

The Incendium has one or two references to social life
in the fourteenth century. “One woman reproved me,''
Rolle says, “ because, wishing to correct their madness in
luxury and daintiness of dress, Ι gazed too long at their
outrageous adornments3 and she said to me that Ι ought
not to look upon women enough even to know whether they
wore horned headdresses or not3 and methought she fairly
answered me.” 1 He refers in another place to the awe-
inspiring size of their “ horned headdresses‘' 2; “the
women of our time are much to be blamed, for they have
invented new ornaments for their heads and bodies, and
clothed themselves in them with such great and marvellous
vanity, that they strike terror and amazement into beholders.
Not only do they, contrary to the word of the Apostle, go
in gold and braided hair, serving pride and wantonness,
but they even transgress human decency and the nature

given by God, and wear upon their heads horned head-

2. Mr.pG. *Gn Coulton supplies me with John Lidgate's reference to
women's “hornesss’in the poem printed in Wright and Halliwell’s Reliquiae
Antiquae, I, 79, which has the suggestive refrain :

“Beaute will shewe, thogh hornes were away.”
One verse may be quoted:
“Grettest of vertues is humylyte,
As Salamon seith, sonne of sapyence,
Most was accepted onto the Deyte.
Taketh heed heros, gevethe to his wordes credence,
How Maria, whiche hadde a premynence
Above all women, in Bedlem whan she lay,
At Crystys birth no eloth of gret dispensa,
She wered a koverchief, hornes were cast away.”
J. H. Wylie, (Henry IV, iv, p. 327) gives a, list of brasses and effigies
illustrating the horned head-dress3 but his statement that Queen Anne of
Bohemia brought “the horned or mitred cap ’' with her to England in 1381,
{gegis to post-date the arrival of the fashion in England. (Ibid., iii, p. 452.)
