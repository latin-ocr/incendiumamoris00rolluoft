62 INCENDIUM AND CANTICLES

with all or part of the Comment on the Canticles sometimes
include these Incendium passages as part of the Canticles,
sometimes the Canticles as part of the Incendium.

Two MSS. include the Incendium as part of a larger
scheme in Rolle's work1 ε

(l) ff. 102b, 103, label: classifies Rolle’s
Comment on the Canticles as Lib. 1.
De amore Dei contra amatores mundi as Lib. 2.
Incendium Amoris as Lib. 3.

Regula uiuendi as Lib. Ι.
De amore Dei contra amatores mundi 35 Lib. 2.
Incendium Amoris 35 Lib. 3.
Melum contemplatiuo‘rum 35 Lib. 4.

But the arrangement here is probably merely that of the
scribe, and implies no intrinsic connexion. There seems
no doubt that Rolle originally wrote the Comment on the
Canticles and the Incendium 35 separate works, and that
the existent MS. confusion between them is merely scribal,
though of very early origin.

Analysis of the manuscript evidence seems to show that
some very early copyist of the Comment on the Canticles
proceeded to copy a few passages from the Incendium, the
two most important of which were chapters 12 and 15, the
first chapters in the book where Rolle writes his own auto-
biography‚ in the first person. The scribe then probably
decided to copy the portioris of the book which are not
autobiographical, but contain his teaching on the contem-
plative life; and in making the abridgment, he (or she)
naturally omitted chapters 12 and 15, which had been
copied before. The incipits and explicits of later scribes
show that they were unable to deal with the confusion thus
created between the Postillae super Canticum Canticorum,
the selected passages S, and the short text of the Incendium,-
