92 FOUNDATION OF SION ABBEY

Saint Saviour‚'' which had been lately drawn up by S.
Bridget of Sweden. S. Birgitta‚1 or Bridget‚ the widow
of a Swedish nobleman‚ had founded the double monastery
of Vadstena‚ in the diocese of Linkoping, on her husband‘s
death in 1344. To avoid the papal prohibition of the
foundation of new orders, the religious at Vadstena were
to live under the “ rule of S. Augustine‚'’ 2 supplemented
by the constitutions drawn up by S. Bridget ;3 they formed
therefore one branch of the so-called Augustinian order of
canons, the proper name of the branch being “The Order
of S. Saviour.’' S. Bridget died in 1323, and was canonised
by Boniface IX in 1391.4 Her constitutions had been
confirmed by Urban VI in 1379,5 and the men’s and
women's convents at Vadstena had been recognised as a
single community ruled by an abbess “under the rule of
S. Augustine and the name of S. Saviour.” Both the
confirmation of the constitutions and the canonisation of
the saint took place however during the years of the great
schism, and the followers of S. Bridget sought therefore
throughout the council of Constance 6 to obtain a further
confirmation of their constitutions and the canonisation of
their patroness‚ because “all Christendom did not adhere

canonisation in 1419, Martin V speaks of her as ‘⁴ S. Birgitta, quam
vulgares Brigidam appellabant.'' See also Dr. Thorvald Hojer’s Studier,
and the Comtesse de flavigny, La Vz‘e cle S. Briqide de Succle.

2. S. Augustine composed no monastic rule, unless the hortatory letter
to the nuns of Hippo be considered as such3 but a mediaeval compilation
known as the “regula Augustini '' served as a basis for the rule of the
Canons of S. Augustine, the Dominicans, the Hermits of S. Augustine‚
or Austin F riars, and other communities which needed a. somewhat general
rule to supplement by their own constitutions See The new 3οἠαῇ-

The words “ order ’' and “rute” are used loosely in the Acta Sanctorum3
before the 1419 confirmation Martin V speaks of “Ordinem S. Augustini,
S. Salvatoris nuncupatum, sub regula et secundum constitutiones seu
instituta S. Birgittae, alias Brigidae nominatae, institutum et fundatum„ . . .
Nos igitur regulam, constitutiones seu instituta predicta. . . . confirmamus.”
