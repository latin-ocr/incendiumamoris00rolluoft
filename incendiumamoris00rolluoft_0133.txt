same to Henry V, who had newly founded the said
monastery, but as the king learns, did not complete the said
demise.’' 1

This shews that Hinton remained in the hands of
Langley‚ and the other trustees till about 1415-16, when
Henry V was founding Sion, and was then transferred to
him. The arrangement was perhaps made to avoid pay-
ment of the fees on alienation, but more probably as a
merely business device to secure uniformity, that Hinton
might be classed among the other royal estates granted to
Sion, and administered uniformly with them. Sion in-
curred no financial loss, since the 1415 foundation charter
allowed the abbey a revenue of Iooo marks yearly at the
exchequer, till the revenues wherewith the king was endow-
ing her should reach that sum.2 Fitz Hugh himself, as
chamberlain, was certainly cognisant of the arrangement,
if not actually responsible for it.

A study of the Swedish evidence leads Dr. Ho'jer to
conclude that “ no monastery was constructed at Hinton,'' 3
and that “ the extract given by Blunt (from the Martiloge)
does not appear to prove its existence.'' The Swedish
evidence includes an “undated, very much injured and
defective letter from ΒΓ. Katillus to the confessor general of
Vadstena, from which it appears that plans were on fo-ot
to turn a hospital for the poor near York into a Brigittine
monastery‚’‘ but though Henry IV actually applied for
papal sanction thus to convert the decayed hospital of
S. Nicholas without the Walmgate Bar at York, the plan was
not completed.4 To refer to evidence of a somewhat later
date, letters from Vadstena to postulant Brigittines in
England shew that as late as 1418 no formally constituted
community existed at Sion, and that the only professed
Brigittines there were the brothers sent from Vadstena;
the English congregation was “not as yet united and knit
