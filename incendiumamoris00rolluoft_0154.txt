124 FOUNDATION OF SION ABBEY

Sion : but it is curious that the Supplica does not mention
that Alnwick was at the time living as a recluse. This was
perhaps unnecessary when merely permission to transfer
from one order to another was required; and the Supplica
does contain a hint at Alnwick's residence at Westminster
in another place, where it speaks of “ William as of S.
Albans.’' 1

It is curious that both Fishbourn and Alnwick should
have been recluses‚ since the cases when a recluse left his
cell are very rare, and according to Miss Clay,2 are in
England almost confined to these instances connected with
the foundation of Sion. The S. Albans chronicler states
that Fishbourn “had lived as recluse at (the chapel of) S.
Germains‚'’ where he had founded a reclusory‚ and that
Alnwick was a recluse of &Vestminsten One of the original
sisters at Sion was the recluse Margaret of Bodmin, whose
petition to transfer herself to Sion is contained in bishop
Stafford’s register. Sister Joan Sewell, who wrote her
monogram in the margin of (j), signed herself “ Sewella
Sionita Reclusa.'' 3 As her name occurs in the Obit Book,
and among the list of sisters buried “prope gerras ’‘
(screen) at Sion, without any special note of her having
been a recluse, it is probable that here the word “ reclusa ”
is used to signify merely an enclosed sister. The instances‚
however, all tend to shew that the enclosure at Sion was
considered a particularly strict one at the date; even a
Carthusian monk was allowed to transfer himself to Sion.4

The identity of William Alnwick with Henry V's recluse
cannot be regarded as proved, since another recluse existed
simultaneously at VVestminster in 1415. The Sion Marti-
loge includes in its list of benefactors “ Dominus Iohannes
London Reclusus VVestmonasteriiss‘ and Henry Lord
