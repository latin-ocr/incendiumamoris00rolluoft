HISTORY OF SHORT TEXT 89

Rolle was read at the Benedictine abbey of S. Mary’s,
York, in the early fifteenth century, and it is noticeable
that the monk‚ Christopher Braystones, who obtained an
indulgence for readers of the Incendium,¹ was familiar with
the short, not the long, text. Spofforth, his patron, was
abbot of S. Mary’s, York‚ while the indulgence was
granted by the archbishop of York and the bishop of
Philippopolis his suffragan: but there is no conclusive
evidence to connect the authorship of the short text with
York.

The relative number and date of the short text manu-
scripts render it likely that the abridgment was made very
early, possibly by one of the Hampole muns, if they retained
his manuscripts at his death. It seems likely that they, at
any rate, retained the Incendium, since passages of it were
incorporated in the office which they were instrumental in
getting drawn up about 1383. Rolle died in 1349, and the
effort to obtain his canonisation was made about 13833 it
is possible that the abridgment was made before this date ;
or that the nuns of Hampole then sent his manuscript to
York, to be used in the compilation of the office.2 The
fact that the author of the abridgment had access to the
Continent on the Canticles,3 one of Rolle's rarer works,
renders it somewhat likely that she was a Hampole nun3
and the letter of Anselm to the recluses, part of which is
copied among the short passages from the Incendium, is
one which might have been found among the small Ham-
pole library.

The history of the two texts then seems to be briefly this :
Rolle himself wrote the long text, and one of his admirers‚
possibly a Hampole nun, abridged it at a very early date,
omitting the autobiographical passages, and producing a
book suitable for study by a member of a religious order.
