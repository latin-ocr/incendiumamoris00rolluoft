x. PREFACE

England‚ in the century immediately preceding their
dissolution.

Ι wish to acknowledge my debt in the preparation of
this text of the Incendium Amoris to the incessant
kindness and patient criticism of Professor T. F. Tout
and Mr. G. G. Coulton, without whose help the work
would, for the writer, have been scarcely possible. I
should like also to express my thanks to Miss Alice
Gardner and Miss Maud Sellers for much help and
advice3 to Miss Hope Allen, who has not only turned
my attention to the subject, but has given me the benefit
of her wide knowledge of Rolle throughout; to Miss R.
M. Clay, for information concerning the anchorets of
Westminster; to the present Lady Abbess and Commu-
nity of Syon Abbey, for great kindness in giving me all
possible information‚ and especially for allowing me to
reproduce as frontispiece a monogram of Joan Sewell,
similar to those drawn in the two manuscripts of the
Incendium Amoris,· and to Mr. H. M. McKechnie, the
secretary of the Manchester University Press‚ for great
patience and help in preparing the book for the press.
Ι should like also to thank all those who have helped me
to obtain access to manuscripts, especially the Bishop of
Lincoln, Mr. P. VVorsley Wood of Emmanuel College,
Cambridge; Dr. T. A. VValker of Peterhouse3 and Mr.
A. Rogers, of the University Library, Cambridge. In
conclusion, I wish to acknowledge the kindness of the
master and fellows of Emmanuel College in allowing
me to use Emmanuel MS. 35 as the basis of this edition,
and of the editor and publishers of the English Historical
Review for allowing me to reprint the substance of a
note on The Incendium Amoris of Richard Rolle and

ι S. Bonaventura, published in vol. xxix, pp. 99—101.
