72 LIFE OF NEWTON

From the contents of his register‚ Scrope seems to have
appointed a vicar general only in his own absences‚ which
were frequent, though not like that of Arundel, continuous.
Several commissions to the vicariate are recorded between
1398 and his death in 1405, the reason usually given for the
archbishop's absence after 1399 being that “he is about to
travelto London for the holding of the parliament of the lord
king, Henry IV.’' On one or two occasions he appointed
Newton vicar general, on others, some other official or
cathedral dignitary. The entries in the register are not
continuous enough to be a complete record of the inductions‚
institutions‚ etc., of these years: and they appear to bear
out the heading of the registers as that of the archbishop’s
vicars general. When the archbishop was present in York,
the mandates to induet, etc„ ran in his own name, and were
recorded in another section of the register.

There are commissions of the vicariate to Newton again
on 4 February, 1400,1 2o January‚ 1401,2 and 25 May, 1403‚³
with two intermediate ones to other men.4 In all cases
except the last, it is stated that the archbishop is about to
travel to London for the holding of parliament, and the
entries after each commission are few, and run in the name
of the vicar general therein appointed. The entries from
Newton's appointment till 7 April, 1404, are in his hand,

excessus et errores corrigendi puniendi et reformandi, personasque idoneas
ad beneficia quecumque nostrarum Ciuitatis et Diocesis . . . . admittendi,
permutaciones . . . , auctorizandi ..... collacionibus beneficiarum quorum-
cumque ad nostram collacionem spectantibus, qualitercumque nobis specialiter
reseruatur. In quorum testimonium uobis litteras nostras has fieri fecimus
patentes, sigillo nostro signatas, quamdiu nobis placuerit duraturas.’'
(Dated 30 Aug. 1399.)
