S. BERNARD 55

S. BERNARD.

In one MS.l of the Incendium, the last chapter is imper-
fect, and is joined without break or division to part of the
ninth of S. Bernard's Sermones in Cantica.2 S. Bernard’s
work is then copied to the middle of Sermon xxxii, where
the MS. ends imperfectly.3 The Incendium is often found
in the MSS. joined, without any break, to Rolle’s own
Comments anthe Canticles; but the confusion here is merely
scribal. Nevertheless, Rolle in the Incendium borrows
many of the thoughts and phrases of his own Comments on
the Canticles, and in both his Incendium and Canticles
there is a good deal of resemblance to S. Bernard‚ though
no direct quotation from him. In Rolle's Comments on
the Canticles (verse 1, “Oleum effusum nomen tuum‚”)
there is no suggestion that he was acquainted with the
thought which is uppermost in S. Bernard’s sermon on the
same verse,—that the soul should be a reservoir for grace,
storing it till in its abundance it overflowed to others, and
not a canal, too ready to pass on what it had not as yet
itself thoroughly gained4; and there is no more direct
resemblance between the comments of the two men on
verse 2. The interpretation given by them to the same text
is generally different,—very often because Rolle wrote for
the solitary, S. Bernard for his monks of Clairvaux. Thus
Rolle reiterates again and again the duty of joining in the
angelic songs of p-raise3 but it was while he sat alone in

episeopus quondam Herefordensis‚ dominus Thomas Spofforth, sepultus
Eboraci, qui hoc vidit Constanciae in tempore predicti concilii generalis
Constanciae.” And “Predictus papa Alexander quintus fuit baaeaflarius
sacrae Theologiae Oxoniae et doctor Theologiae Parisiis, ut ipse papa in
concilio Pisano dixit domino Thomae Spofforth, abbati ecclesiae beatissimae
Mariae Eboraci, qui dominus Thomas fuit eciam in concilio Constanciensi.’'
(Loci e Libro Veritatum, edit. T. Rogers, pp. 10, 161.) Nearly all the
chief figures connected with the foundation of Sion‚—FitzHugh‚ Fishbourn‚
Alnwick‚ archbishop Arundel and bishop Clifford, Gascoign, etc„ were
north country people.

middle of Rolle’s Postilla super Cantica, Vers. Ι, the hymn “ Ihesu dulcis
memoria,”—then ascribed to S. Bernard.
