104 FOUNDATION OF SION ABBEY

to our order by one and the same profession, neither as yet
completely loosed from the bonds of its former p=rofessions'' ;
the English brothers are “ not yet incorporated in our
Order by holy profession.’' 1

It thus appears that during the years 1408-15 Fitz Hugh
maintained the two brothers sent from Vadstena at his own
eost, and possibly at Hinton : but there is no evidence that
any postulants joined them during the period. The labours
of Peterson and Katillus probably consisted in the confer-
ences and preparations which must have preceded the accom-
plishment of so large a scheme as the foundation in 1415 :
and in the explanation of the rule or constitutions to the
religious of other orders. The delay in the foundation of
the community was almost certainly due to Fitz Hugh‘s
expectation that Henry IV would found it himself, on a
larges scale than he could have attempted: perhaps as one
of the three houses which Henry was enjoined by
Gregory XII to build‚ in expiation for the murder of
Richard ΙΙ and archbishop Scrope, Fitz Hugh‘s uncle‚—a
mandate which perhaps inspired his son’s foundations of
Sion and Sheen‚ and the attempted foundation of
Celestines.2 The financial difficulties of Henry, however,
prevented the realisation of Fitz Hugh’s hopes. A
letter from Vadstena to Henry V in 1415 hopes that
“even as Solomon magnificently consummated the temple
which David his father planned to build‚ so also may the
merciful integrity of your majesty bring to due fulfilment a
monastery of this kind, which the devout intention of your
generous father, hindered by death, could not achieve.’' 3
The language of the 1444 grant to Hinton also points to
this ε Fitz Hugh did not in his original charter, as this grant
states, “ give the land to the trustees, that they might give
it to the king, that he might give it to Sion '’ z but simply

3. Diplomatarium, iii, no. 2082. This agrees with Fitz Hugh's stipula-
tion that his grant, of land should hold good “even if these, brethren
shall have been granted any other dwelling or site by the lord king.’'
