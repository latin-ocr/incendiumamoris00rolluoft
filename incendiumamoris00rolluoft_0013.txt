treatises found a place in sixteenth and seventeenth
century collections of religious works‚ but the bulk of
Rolle’s Latin writings remained unpublished.

The first systematic study of Rolle’s life and works,
including the Latin treatises‚ was made by Dr. C.
Horstman, but unfortunately his Richard Rolle of
Hampole and his Followers, published in 1896, remains
unfinished. The first two volumes which he published
give most careful transcripts of Rolle’s Middle English
works, often with versions from more than one manu-
script. The second volume gives further a list of Rolle’s
Latin works, including some whose ascription to Rolle
was only provisional. To this is added a life and
criticism of Rolle valuable because based on a study of
the Latin treatises in manuscript, as well as of the
Middle English tracts and poems. The Latin treatises
themselves Dr. Horstman intended to publish in other
volumes of his work. Unfortunately he never carried
out this plan.

The most recent study of Rolle's works as a whole has
been made by Miss Hope Allen, of Radcliffe College,
U.S.A. Struck by the dissimilarity of outlook between
the stolid dogmatism of the Prick os Conscience, the
longest work hitherto ascribed to Rolle, and the marked
individuality and mysticism of his other works, Miss
Allen examined the external and interna] evidence for
Rolle's authorship of the Prick os conscience, and found

’ that, beyond the tradition, the ascription of the work to

him rested on the slenderest grounds. These conclusions
she published in 1908. Since then she has been engaged
in examining the English and continental manuscripts
of Rolle’s works, preparatory to publishing a critical
estimate of Rolle’s work, based on a careful collation of
all the sources. She discovered in a manuscript con-
taining Rolle’s Incendium Amoris and other of his
works (Emmanuel College, Cambridge, MS. 35), the
marginal notes of John Newton‚ who was treasurer at
