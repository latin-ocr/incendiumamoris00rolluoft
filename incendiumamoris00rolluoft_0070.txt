40 ΑΙΜ OF INCENDIUM

be remembered how common a feature of the fourteenth
century was the recluse life,1 and that its apparent and
distinctive sign was fixity of abode. The would-be recluse,
before he could retire to his cell, obtained permission from
the bishop, after shewing that he possessed means of
sustenance3 but when this permission had been granted,
and the recluse had been solemnly enclosed by the bishop
or his delegate, only danger to life itself, or the claim of
canonica] obedience, could withdraw the recluse from his
cell. Instances have even been known when the recluse
preferred to be burned to death, rather than leave it. The
hermit similarly, though not always enclosed, was bound
to one place of abode. Had Rolle ‹chosen either of these
vocations‚ and been formally “ inclusus’' by the bishop,
he would have occupied a normal place in the social fabric,
and been untroubled by “detractores’': but he seems,
from what he tells us, to have held himself free to leave
whatever shelter he had found, when a prospect of greater
solitude offered itself, or the demands of his own spirit
urged him on. “For I withdrew from many, not because
they fed me coarsely and hardly, but because our manner
of life accorded not, or for another reasonable cause. For
I dare to say, with blessed Job‚ that fools have despised me,
and when I withdrew from thern, they slandered me.
Nevertheless they shall blush when they see me, these who
said that I would not dwell anywhere, except where I might
be fed delicately.‘’2

The Incendium Amoris itself is a rambling biography, an

· explanation of “how Richard Hampole came to the Fire

of Love '': or, as one MS. puts it, perhaps copying his
own note: “How I carne to the Fire of Love.’'3 The
purpose of the book is described in the Prologue:

“I have wondered more than I can tell,'' Rolle says,
“when first Ι felt my heart grow warm, and glow with no
imaginary,but with a real‚and as it were‚sensible flame. So
