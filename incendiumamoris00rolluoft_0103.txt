DEATH OF SCROPE 73

and the register ends abruptly‚ without the formula of the
handing over the seal of office in the chapter, and the “ Et
sie finit Registrum'’ of the earlier registers. The unfinished
register of the vicar general thus mutely records the sudden
and tragic end of the archbishop.

The part played by Newton at York during the troubles
that culminated in the hurried execution of archbishop
Scrope was probably quiet and uneventful : but he was one
of that disaffected body, the cathedral chapter, and the
friend and special servant of the archbishop, so that it is not
wonderful that from this date he was no longer appointed
to sit on special commissione by the Crown,1 and that his
name does not occur in the register of the next archbishop
of York,——Henry Bovvet.2 It is scarcely to be doubted that
he sided with his brothers of the chapter in conniving at the
pilgrimages to the tomb of the martyred archbishop‚ which
caused such annoyance to Henry IV; and particularly as he
was still treasurer of the cathedral, and busy from this time
onwards in repairing the fabric of the cathedral. On 29
May, 1409, the chapter ordained that offerings made at the
tomb of archbishop Scrope should be devoted to these
same repairs,3 so that Newton must have had a direct
financial interest in promoting them. After Scrope’s death
Newton’s life seems to have been spent mainly among his
books and in his duties as treasurer.4 In 1405 Sir John
Scrope, brother of the archbishop‚ made Newton one of his
executor535 Skyrlaw‚ Bishop of Durham‚ bequeathed him
a silver bovvl,6 and Sir John Deepden his “best

commissions, mainly incident on the Northern Risings; C. P. R„ 13 Sept.

no vicar general; the entries in his register begin, “Hem-icus, diuma
permissione‚'' etc.
