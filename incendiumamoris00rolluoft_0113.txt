AUTHORSHIP OF THE SHORT TEXT 83

Library‚ and sister Joan here merely, marked the difference
in text between the long and the short, comparing it with
her own copy. It is interesting that both the mediaeval
students of the text of the Incendium should have been in
possession of the same manuscript; and the friendship of
the Brigittine sister and the Carthusian monk lends a
human interest to the later history of the text.

(6) AUTHORSHIP oF THE SHORT TEXT.

No light is thrown upon the authorship of the short text
of the Incendium by any headings or notes in the manu-
scripts themselves, nor does the relative number and dating
of the long and short text manuscripts do more than shew
that the abridgment is of very early date. Of the 26
known manuscripts 15 are long and 11 short, and only
three can be dated with certainty.

(l) is dated May 13, 1411, and is long.
(h) is dated at about 1408, and is short.
(j) dates from before 1412, and contains both.

The evidence as to the relation of the long and short
texts from the dating of the manuscripts is thus incon-
clusive; but the confusion between the short text and Rolle’s
Postillae super canticum canticorum, discussed earlier,
shewed that the short text was an abridgment3 and analysis
of the short text itself both confirms this theory and throws
light upon the aim of the scribe who made the abridgment‚
though, unfortunately, not upon his or her identity.

The earlier part of the short text is so continuous
as to conceal the fact that it is an abridgment at
all, but this is not the case throughout. There
are thirty-nine omitted passages alto-gether, and
throughout the first part of the book the selection was made
with such care, that the text reads without any verbal
break, and usually without any break in the thought. In
some cases even, where the scribe has omitted one of
Rolle's characteristic digressions‚ and picked up the thread
