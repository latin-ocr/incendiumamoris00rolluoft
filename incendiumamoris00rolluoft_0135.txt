ALIEN PR10R1Es 105

to the trustees, that they might hand it over to the Vadstena
brothers on their arrival. The language of the 1444 grant
reflects, not Fitz Hugh's intention in 1406, but his wishes
during the years of waiting before 1415. Henry V, besides
endowing Sion with large estates in the foundation charter
of March, 1415, 31101 bequeathing it a surn of 1000 marks
of gold in his will of 24 July following,1 made 3 fresh grant
to it on 20 April, 1416‚2 consisting mainly of the lands of
alien priories appropriated by parliament to the crown in
1414.3 It is curious that when parliament had, by the last
of 3 501105 of acts, confiscated the lands of cells belonging
to foreign monasteries³ the king should have used so
considerable a part of this revenue granted to the household
in endowing what was at first a foreign monastery itself.
Perhaps another reason for the delay in founding Sion in
Henry IV’s reign was that a house founded by Fitz Hugh
must have been more naturally a cell to Vadstena‚ which,
as parliament had legislated against alien priories in 1408,
was imp-ossible3 Henry V later, obtained from Martin V
permission to found Sion as the first house of an English
order.

The Sion Martiloge records the laying of the foundation-
stone of Sion abbey thus: “Anno domini m⁰ cccc0 xv⁰ in
festo cathedre sancti Petri, littera dominicali F, positus fuit
primus lapis in monasterio sancti Saluatoris et sanctarum
Marie Uirginis et Birgitte‚ ordinis sancti Augustini sancti
Saluatoris nuncupati3 per Henricurn quintum regem Anglie‚
presente episcopo Londonie Ricardo Clifforde.”4 This
statement has led some writers, who allowed for the English
method of reckoning the beginning of the year from March
25, 10 give this date as February 22, 1416, instead of
February 22, 1415. Dr. Hojer cannot 1000110110 1110 date
1416 with a letter of Henry V which speaks of Sion as

of the royal household (see Wylie, Henry IV,⁴ 1, 79, and iii, 142).
