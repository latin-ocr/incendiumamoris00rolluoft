70 LIFE OF NEWTON

treasurer of the cathedral‚l in succession to Thomas Clifford,
whose will was entered in the register‚2 and proved before
Newton as treasurer 25 June, 1393.

Newton's successor as vicar general, April 6, 1396, was
John Bottlesham 3 (afterwards bishop of Rochester)‚ who,
curiously enough, was also for a short time his successor
as master of Peterhouse‚ Cambridge: the two men had
probably been acquainted there and at Ely. Like Cawood‚
Bottlesham was, at the time of his appointment‚ the bishop‘s
chancellor, not, like Newton, his official.4 The entries in
the few remaining pages of Arundel’s register⁵ run in
Bottlesham’s name ε Arundel was translated to Canterbury
in 1396, and Bottlesham resigned his register and seat into

the hands of the cathedral chapter.
There is no evidence that Newton held office under the

next archbishop, whose tenure of the see was short. Arch-
bishop· Waldby's register was kept by William Cawood‚6
his vicar genera13 and Newton's name does not occur in it.

In April, 1397, Newton resigned his mastership- of Peter-
house,7 which he had continued to hold, though resident at
