52 S. BONAVENTURA

states that Thomas (Spofforth), bishop of Hereford, the
archbishop of York, and certain other bishops whose names
enable the indulgence to be dated at 1452-7, have granted
an indulgence of forty days to the devout reader of a chapter
of the Incendium, at the request of Christopher Braystone5‚
a monk of S. Mary's, York. A memorandum in a different
fifteenth century hand follows, by a monk of the Carthusian
house of Beauvale in Nottinghamshire, asking the prayers
of the reader for Christopher Braystones‚ once monk of
S. Mary's, York, then chaplain to Spofforth, and finally
monk at Beauvale, to which house he gave the book. The
curious fact that Spofforth's name takes precedence of the
archbishop of York's in the indulgence suggests that his
own chaplain, Christopher ‘⁶ Braystanes'’ or “ Brestons‚''
may himself have copied the Indulgence into the book
which he so highly esteemed‚ and the different forms of the
chaplain’s name also suggest this. Braystones is a little
hamlet near S. Bees, Cumberland, and while Brestons
would be the form which the Carthusian monk of Beauvale
would write, Braystanes would be the Northern dialectal
form, natural to Christopher himself. Thomas Spofforth,
his patron, was abbot of the Benedictine abbey of S. Mary‘s
at York from 1405 till 1421,1 and bishop of Hereford from
1442 till his resignation in 1448. In 1415 he was one of
the additional ambassadors sent by Henry V to the council
of Constance‚2 where he remained for two years, and was
