THE ADDITIONES AT SION 121

the murder of Richard II ancl archbishop Scrope, Fitz
Hugh’s uncle, and it is possible that the idea of this form
of expiation dated from this interview with the recluse.1 The
theory is at any rate plausible and it would be natural that
in such a case Henry should appoint as the first confessor
of Sion the man who had suggested its foundation, and
whose holiness he must have highly esteemed.

The information of the S. Albans chronicler concerning
“ William Alnwyk‚ recluse monk of Westminster ‘’ is
supported by two documents‚ both of which state that
Alnwick was a Benedictine of S. Albans. This explains
the S. Albans' chronicler’s source of information‚ and his
chatty and obscure reference to Alnwick's appointment to
Sion; and though it does not explain how the monk of S.
Albans became the “ recluse monk of Westminster‚'’ there
is no prima facie difficulty in the retirement of a Benedictine
monk, with the perniission of his abbot‚ to any reclusory,
particularly to one, as in this case, in another Benedictine
house. One of the two documents which refer to Alnwick
is the copy of a prologue to the Additz'ones2 to the rule
· of S. Bridget (the “ rule of S. Saviour ”), and the other
a supplica or petition of Henry V to Martin V concerning
Sion.

The British Museum manuscript of the Additiones is
imperfect, the beginning and end being missing, but the
present community of Sion possesses a seventeenth century
copy of the Additiones, drawn up at Lisbon in the course
of the wanderings of the community. A Latin prologue
gives the names of the religious from Benedictine, Cistercian
and Cluniae houses who met, by the command of Henry
V, in the inharmonious conference of January 1416, and

1. Or that he recommendet} carrying out the papal suggestions given to
Henry IV. in 1408.

2. The Additiones were the regulations drawn up for the guidancetof
Sion. Arundel MS. 146 is a manuscript of these Additiones as applylng
to the sisters, and has been printed in Aungier‚ p. 249. The MS. must
have remained for some time without covers, or unbound, as the first and
last folios are much worn, and illegible. Cap. i of the Additiones (which
Aungier prints from another MS„ belonging to the dean and chapter of
S. Paul's) is missing.
