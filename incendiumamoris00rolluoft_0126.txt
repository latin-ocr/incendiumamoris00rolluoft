history as the trusted follower of both Henry IV and
Henry V. He was a nephew of archbishop Scrope, but
helped to suppress the northern rising of 1405, and was
actually present with the force which captured him.l Henry
IV granted him the custody of the temporalities of the see
of York after Scrope’s death‚2 when he must have been
brought into contact with John Newton‚ the vicar—general
of his uncle.3 Henry IV also made him a member of other
commissions incident on the northern risings‚ and in 1412
rewarded him with an income of ,6100 annually,4 “the
king considering how at divers times the said Henry has
laboured in Scotland and elsewhere, and in Denmark, for
the marriage of the king’s daughter, the Queen of Denmark,
and done service to the king’s son John, without due wages,
except an annuity of 100 marks granted to him by the king
by letters patent, of which 750 marks are now due to him,''
etc.

On the coronation of Henry V he was appointed constable
of England, and he is mentioned as the king's chamberlain
in March, 1415.5 Till his death in 1424 he formed one of
the king's household‚ and was in constant attendance upon
him. He had thus considerable influence under Henry
IV, was himself part of the machine of central government
under Henry V, and was also a prominent Yorkshire
gentleman‚ taking a considerable part in local history and
administration, a fa-ct the more natural in a reign when the
political centre of gravity inclined so strongly towards the
northern counties. It is interesting that FitzHugh‚ like
Newton‚ possessed a copy of Rolle‘s Incendium Amoris,
possibly even the holograph copy from which Newton
emended his own short text. In 1415 Henry Lord Scrope
