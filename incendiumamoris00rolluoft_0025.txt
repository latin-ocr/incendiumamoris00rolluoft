INCENDIUM AMORIS.

Rolle's original manuscript of the Incendium Amoris has not
been preserved. There are in England twenty-six manuscripts
of the Incendium Amoris, of which fourteen contain the text in
its original form, and are called in the diagram, and throughout
this edition, long text manuscripts. The best of these long text
manuscripts are (j), (k), (l), (w) ; but none are of certain

e 1 re .
p ἐξ ΕΞΓΙΥ scribe, whose identity is unknown, abridged the

Incendium Anzorz‘s; eleven manuscripts contain his abridgment,
and are called in this edition short text manuscripts.

John Newton, treasurer at York 1393—1414,owned an abridged
manuscript, (j), of the Incendium Amoris. He emended it, as
he states in a marginal note, from the “book which Saint
Richard of Hampole wrote with his own hand.'' (j) thus con-
tains both the long and short forms of the text, of which the
long is a first-hand copy of Rolle's manuscript by a careiul
scribe. It has therefore been followed in this edition: but it
does not differ substantially from the other long text manu-
scripts.

The short text manuscripts shew considerable confusion with
Rolle’s Postillae super Canticum Canticorum. This is shewn in
the diagram, and is due to the fact that an early scribe (probably
the author of the short text oi the Incendium Amoris) produced
a selection of passages from both the Postillae super Canticum
Canticorum and the Incendium Amoris, which has been widely
copied.
