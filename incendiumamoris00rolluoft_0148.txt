118 FOUNDATION OF SION ABBEY

1396,1 and became subpri0r2 there: he, however, lived
continuously at S. Albans, making antiphonars and having
the chapel roof mended,3 etc., etc„ till long after 1426, when
the famous William Alnwick became bishop of Norwich.

In face of these difficulties, it seems best to conclude that
William Alnwick, Benedictine of S. Albans, and William
Alnwick, doctor of law, were different persons, and that the
first became confessor of Sion, the second keeper of the
privy seal and bishop of Norwich. This conclusion 4 is
rendered certain by the references in the S. Albans chronicle
to Fishbourn, and by some documents relating to Alnwick
in the Swedish royal archives.

The S. Albans chronicler states that William Alnwick
was a “ recluse monk of erstminster,'’—a suitable person
to govern a house whose inmates were so strictly enclosed,
that they were sometimes loosely spoken of as “ recluses ’⁹ 3⁵
this man was “given the charge of the women,'’ but “at
the end ot' a year, worn out by age and weariness, he
returned to his cell.’' This description fits in with the
known difficulties of the community at Sion, and with the
share of Thomas Fishbourn in its foundation. The Sion
Martiloge consistently alludes to Fishbourn as the first
confessor3 and in recording the list of benefactors for whom
six masses were annually celebrated, it mentions first king
Henry V, then Fitz Hugh, and thirdly, “the confessor
Thomas‘’ (i.e. Fishbourn), “because he, being the confessor
and counsellor of the king our founder, procured his favour
for the founding and endowment of the monastery.'’ 6
Fishbourn’s name occurs in nearly all the early references
to Sion, and it was he who actually journeyed to Rome in
