38 ROLLE'S LIFE

was born‚1 about 1300,2 at Thornton Dale‚ in the East
Riding of Yorkshire, and, according to the office, was sent
to Oxford by the patronage of Thomas Neville,3 archdeacon
of Durham about 1316. Scholasticism was not essentially
hostile to mysticism‚ but Rolle, according to his own
account, found the scholastic teaching at Oxford sterile and
unprofitable, and about the age of nineteen returned to his
Northern home, to enter upon the life of a wandering
hermit. “ Ι give thanks to God,” he says in the Incendium,
“ Who, without any merit of mine, for my good and for
His honour thus chastened His child, thus affrighted His
servant, so that it seemed to me a sweet thing to fiee the
few and transitory delights of the world.'’4 Other pass·
ages bear witness to his disgust at the intellectual subtlety
he found prevalent at Oxford, and at the “great theologians,
wrapped about in endless questionings,'’ and their teaching.
Nevertheless, Rolle was not a mystic “in vacuo” : he lived
in the same century as Hilton and Julian of Norwich,
Eckhart and Ruysbroech, Tauler and Suso, S. Catherine of
Siena and Dante Alighieri. The works of earlier mystics‚
S. Bernard, S. Bonaventura and the Victorines were
studied by the spiritual guides of the day; and the
teaching and methods of these writers appear in solution
in Rolle's own writings. Rolle quotes, for a mediaeval
writer, singularly little, owing probably to his manner of
life, cut off from books,5 and this makes it difficult to assess
the influence of particular writers upon him. But while
all the evidence points to his having had only a second-
hand acquaintance with the continental mystics, his inhesit-
ance of a deposit of mystical thought is quite clear.

1. He was the son of william Rolle. Whittaker's Richmond has no
reference to a. “Rolle” family3 G. H. Plantagenet-Harrison, in his History
of Yorkslzire, has one or two references to a Richard de Rollos and a.
William de Rollos in the reigns of Stephen and John, but nothing later.

5. Perhaps also to his dissatisfaction with the writings of others on

the subject of contemplation, as he tells us in the Incendium, cap. 32, p. 237.
