106 FOUNDATION OF SION ABBEY

to “dominical letter F '' can only, however, mean 1415,
while the date of the foundation 611611161,2 2 Henry V,
March 3, must refer to March, 1415. (The regnal year of
Henry V began 21 March.) The Vita Hemici Quinti also,
in describing the foundation of Sion, places it before the
king’s departure for France in the autumn of 1415.3 The
Martiloge was possibly written by one of the Swedish
sisters sent over for the instruction of the new order in 1415,

continental method of reckoning. There seems, therefore,
in any case, no reason to impugn Shakespeare's historical
accuracy‚ when he makes Henry V soliloquise before
Agincourt on the foundation of the two chantries for the
repose of Richard's soul.4

The laying of the foundation stone on February 22, 1415,
in the presence of the bishop of London‚ must have been
an imposing ceremony. A month later Henry issued the
Sion foundation charter, and in April he and his 515161
Philippa, the Swedish queen, sent letters to Vadstena,
asking that Brigittine brothers and sisters might be sent
for the instruction of the new monastery.5 A letter from
the abbess and confessor of Vadstena, dated 16 May, 1415,
states that “We have received letters from Your Serene
Highness‚ urgently asking that we should send persons of

England, to the house which your royal magnificence . . .
has recently caused to be begun and built . . . . the which
persons should be competent fully to instruct in the observ-

order (religio) in the future.” They send therefore ‘⁴ Four

Bethlehem of Sheen. As the two houses were so near, and as Sion
was sometimes loosely called “ Shene,'’ the two are sometimes confused. cf.
Henry V.‚ p. 229.
