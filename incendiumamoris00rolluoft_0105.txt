NEWTON’S WILL 75

are some to William Waltham‚ Thomas Haxey,l and the
justice, Richard Norton,2—all three his executors. The only
relations mentioned in the will are his brother, Thomas
Newton,3 Joan his wife, and their sons and daughters.
These were probably still young, for their names are not
given ε to his nieces Newton left suitable marriage portions,
and “to any son of his brother Thomas who might study
law” all his books “tam Juris Civilis quam Canonici.’'
These in the meanwhile were to be kept by the cathedral
chapter in a certain chest, and the books were to revert to
them if no son of the said Thomas followed his uncle’s steps
in the study of law.

Newton bequeathed to the chapter at York “ three silver
bowls, with wheels on the base, to maintain three torches
before the high altar, together with twelve silver chargers
and twelve dishes for the high altar ''; the plate of the
cathedral had been in his own charge till 1404, when he
appointed Thomas Garton sub-treasurer under him.4 An
inventory‚ compiled about 1500, “omnium iocalium
vasarum, auri et argenti—et librorum, ad ecclesiam Cath.
Ebor. pertinencium, in custodia subthesaurarii eiusdem
ecclesie,’' mentions other gifts of plate‚ etc.‚ by Newton‚
not specified in his will.⁵
