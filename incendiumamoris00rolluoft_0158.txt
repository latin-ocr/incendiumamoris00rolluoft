128 FOUNDATION OF SION ABBEY

of ours ”; the remaining four-fifths of the letter cover new
ground, the matters which the three recipients of the bull
are to arrange, with the papal authority, in connexion with
the foundation of Sion. The bull proceeds:

Since1 the king fears that owing to lack of knowledge,
errors may have been committed in the foundation of
Sion, or in the manner of the reception of religious to
that monastery, or that such may occur in other monas-
teries of the order which may be founded;

and since ² he wishes that the holy See would make
provision concerning these and the following matters,
namely: the mode of reception, age of reception‚ etc., of
brothers and sisters, the election of an abbess and con-
fessor, celebration of Mass and the divine office,
consecrations and ordinations at Sion, the egress of
ordinands or ingress of those administering orders,
dispensations and relaxations of the rule for the sick‚
opportunities for secular or regular priests, even of the
Carthusian order, to minister to the enclosed at Sion, and
the confessions of brothers and sisters, pilgrims and
secular persons at Sion;

We3 therefore command that you, or any one or two
of you, with the authority of the apostolic See: amend
any error in the foundation of Sion, and receive and
admit to regular profession those who wish to enter the
monastery, that they may then elect an abbess and con-
fessor;

and that you make provision in the aforesaid particulars
for the rule and government of Sion, and similar houses;

and that you allow any person of any order of a less
strict observance to transfer themselves to the order of
S. Augustine, called that of S. Saviour, hold office therein
etc., the leave of their superiors not being required;

notwithstanding any constitutions of Boniface VIII,
or any other constitutions to the contrary.
