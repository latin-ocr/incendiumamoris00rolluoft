ROLLE AND OTHER MYSTics 49

dium, but depends rather on the solution of the problem of
the authorship of several minor tra-ets, sometimes ascribed
to Rolle. In some of these,l passages are quoted from the
Fathers: S. Gregory, S. Augustine, S. Bernard, etc.‚ by
name: but such quotations occur only in the tracts whose
authorship is uncertain, and not in Rolle's more important
Latin works: the comment on the Cautio-les, the De amore
Dei contra amatores mundi, the Regula uiuendi, etc. In
the Incendium itself the only verbal quotations are from
the Vulgate, although passages occur which suggest an
acquaintance with the thought of the pseudo-Dionysius, the
Victorines‚ and S. Bernard. All these passages might
have been derived from an indirect acquaintance with these
writers, or merely from participation in the current theo·
logical thought of the day.

S. BONAVENTURA.

Horstman‚ in his Richard Rolle and his sollowcrs,
suggests that the influence chiefly traceable in Rolle‘s
writings is that of S. Bonaventura. Since Franciscan
influence was strong during Rolle's stay at Oxford, this is
not improbable; and Miss Hope Allen, who has studied
the works of Richard Rolle as a whole, considers that some
of them contain a good deal of the teaching of Bonaventura
in solution. The influence is, however, not at all apparent
in the Incendium Amoris, although a very interesting
confusion has occurred between the Prologue of the Incen-
dium, and Bonaventura’s De Triplici Via.2 It is clear,
however, that here a passage frorn Rolle's work was incor-
porated by a scribe in that of the Italian mystic (vide infra).
Though Horstman does not mention this confusion, it is
possible that, without having worked the matter out, he
believed Rolle to have borrowed the passage from Bona-
ventura, and to have founded the Incendium upon it; and
that this accounts for the predominant place which he
assigns to Bonaventura among those who influenced Rolle.

This however is surmise, as Horstman gives no indication
