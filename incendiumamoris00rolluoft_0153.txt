ALNWICK AT S. ALBANS 123

Additz'ones were examined in 1473 by Thomas (Kemp), the
diocesan‚ bishop of London, and again examined and
re-issued at Lisbon in 1607, in accordance with S. Bridget's
constitutions as ratified by the council of Trent.

The mis-spelling “ Anroyte ’' for “ Alnwick‚’' probably
due to a Spanish scribe, is paralleled in the second docu-
ment, where Alnwick’s name appears as “ Alne Wych.‘'
Henry V in 1417 addressed a supplica 1 or petition to Martin
V to confirm the foundation of Sion abbey, sending it first
to Vadstena for the approbation of the parent house. The
document is copied in the Swedish royal archives‚ and in it
Henry asks for the papal confirmation of “a monastery, with
church, belfry‚ dwelling place, dormitory, kitchen garden,
etc.,’' 101 1116 1156 01 1116 1311161 and seventeen brothers 01 1116
016161 01 S. Saviour, and a similar monastery “near to it,
though separate and completely shut off from it ’' 101 1116
use 01 1116 mother and sisters, to the number of sixty.
Henry V also begged 101 1116 papal blessing upon “ Willel-
mum Alne Wych‚ monachum expresse professum monasterii
5311611 Albani, Ordinis sancti Benedicti, Lincolniense dio-
cesi in sacerdocio constitutum,'' and “ Matildam Neueyaton
monialem expresse professam monasterii de Barking‚ ordinis
sancti Benedicti‚dicte Londoniensis diocesiS,''whom he had
nominated as confessor and abbess‚ or upon those whom the
community might elect as confessor and abbess. He asked
also that the said William 01 S. Albans and Matilda of
Barking might transfer themselves to the aforesaid monas-
tery of Sion and order of S. Augustine, receive the habit,
and make a regular profession,2 —a request that shews that
the Supplica must have been drawn up before Alnwick’s
retirement to WVestminster. Since Alnwick was a Benedic-
tine of S. Albans‚ it is natural that the S. Albans chronicler
should have information concerning the early years of

2. The Supplica is undated, but, occurs in the royal archives among the
documents of 14183 it must, however, certainly have been drawn up before
17 May, 1417, when Henry granted Matilda N ewton a pension to become
a recluse at, Barking.
