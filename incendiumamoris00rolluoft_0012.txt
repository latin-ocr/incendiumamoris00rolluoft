works, This suspicion was perhaps partly due to his
denunciation of scholastic teaching‚ and advocacy of an
original mode of life, bound by no religious vows. It
was however much more the result of his equivocal
popularity among the Lollards. The latter not merely
admired and studied his works, but interpolated into the
text of some of his books sundry flagrant insertions of
their own, which the criticism of that age was not able to
detect.

The second reason which limited the popularity of the
Latin treatises was the fact that Rolle on principle
belonged to no religious order, which would have been
interested in preserving his works in the middle ages,
and in publishing them later. Had Rolle been a
Benedictine or a friar, his work would almost certainly
have become known to his brethren in religion on the
continent, as well as to those in England. As it was,
the traces of his influence on the continent are very small
indeed. Rolle's life, and the fate of his works, illustrate
particularly well the position and limitations of the
mystic as the free lance in religion : the man for whom,
according to baron von Hijgel’s Classical definition, the
intuitive or personal element in religion far outweighs
the historical and institutional elements. Rolle's dis-
regard for the institutional support which membership
of a religious order would have given him was funda-
mental to his own conception of the contemplative life,
and his own progress in that life was no doubt conditioned
by it. Yet it meant the limitation of his influence almost
to the sphere of personal contact during his life-time, and
to little more than the northern counties of England after
his death. His reputation was never more than insulas,
and might also be called local. The Latin treatises thus
largely missed their natural public before the Reforma-
tion‚ and though they were preserved afterwards in
manuscript in English libraries‚ those who had access
to them had no inclination to print them. One or two
