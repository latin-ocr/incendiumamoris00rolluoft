Explicit liber de Amore dei contra amatores mundi

secundum Ricardum uenerabilem Heremitam de Hampole.
Amen quoth J.H. (The scribe's initials. This does not
affect the question as to whether Rolle himself wrote the
Incendium, as the writing of the De amore dei, though
early, is quite a different one. The initials of the scribe,
J,H.‚recall the owner of (r), “ Iohannis Hanton, mona-
chus Ebor.,'' but Mr. Madan has kindly compared the
writings for me, and considers them not to be identical.)
Nota quod ab inicio alteracionis uite (the note follows, as
printed p. 188, which is given also by the scribe of (Z).
The Durham scribe, J.H., gives “abscondit'’ for “ascen-
dit,'’ “consumptus’' for “consummatus,” which seem less
good readingS, and “ purificacionis '¹ instead of “uisita-
cionis'' for the date of the dream. Probably both J.H. and
the scribe oi (l) had a common source,—which may or
may not have been a note made by the Hermit of Tanfield
on the MS. of Rolle's which he possessed.)

Hereford Cathedral MS. O. VIII. 1=(x).

Folio, vellum, 16in. by 11in. Dated by Canon W. W.
Capes as Sec, XIV late, or Sec. XV early,—probably
the latter; in wooden covers, and chained. Writing
very clear, in two columns; not foliated. No headings
or marginal comments. On the inside of the cover, a
XV-century hand, probably the owner’s, has written:
“liber M(agistri) Oweyin' lloid’,'‘ and on the back of
the volume, under a horn label‚l is written “ Ex dono
magistri Oweni Lloyd quondam Canonici huius eccle-
sie.” These notes are probably the source of an entry
in the manuscript, List of Benesactors to He'reford
Cathedral Library, to be found in the library3 under
the heading “ Ex dono doctoris Oweni Lloyde huius
ecclesie canonici '‘ the names of 26 MSS. are given,

’ 1. The books left by Newton to the Chapter of York were “horned and
chained ’³ exactly as this volume, see p. 79.
