54 s. BONAVENTURA

revival of the Benedictine order‚1 and Spofforth was called
upon to help in reforms similar to, though wider than those
which had been carried out in his own abbey in 1390. In
that year a commission had been issued by the archbishop
of York to inquire into and reform the observance of the
Benedictine rule at S. Mary‘s2: the commission had sat
under the presidency of the abbot and the archbishop's two
commissioners, the senior of whom was John Newton, a
student of Rolle, and the owner of Emman. MS. 35=(j) of
his Incendium. The reforms were mainly liturgical, and
were embodied in the Consuetudinarium of S. Mary’s.³
There is evidence that the Incendium was in use as a
monastic text-book at S. Mary's during the period following
the reforms‚ since Braystones was a monk there, and
another important Incendium manuscript4 belonged to
“ Iohannes Hanton, monachus Ebor.’' ⁵ It seems therefore
possible that the Incendium became known to the contin-
ental Benedictines through Spofforth, when they met to
draw up a scheme of internal reform similar to, though
wider than, the one at S. Mary‘s; if the monk Braystones,
afterwards his chaplain, accompanied Spofforth to Con-
stance‚ either man may have been the means by which the

Incendium disturbed the history of Bonaventura’s work.⁶

6, Spofforth's presence at Constance, together with FitzHu rh and
Richard Clifford, is interesting as regards a possible connexion etween
Newton and Sion Abbe see p. 73) Spofforth was well acq uainted with
Newton, and he was {ere fellow- )ambassador with FitzHug h, the first
patron of Sion, and Clifford, afterwards bishop of London, and mentioned
in the Sion Martiloye more than once as a benefactor. Political interest
at the council of Constance centred in the healing of the schism, and the
efforts of European rulers to help or hinder it3 but to contemporaries and
ecclesiastics, the canonisation of S. Bridg et of Sweden loomed very large,
as a topic of interest. (Vide Lenfant gand Richental.) To FitzHugh,
who 111 1414 had been working for six years to found a Brigittine monastery
in Eng land, the canonisation must have been of special interest. Gascoign,
the author of the [siber Veritatum‚ a friend of Fishbourn and Robert Bell,
the first and second confessors general at Sion, (see p. 129), twice mentions
the presence of Sp offorth at Constance: “Et predicti Johannes Huss et
Jerom'mus de Praga fuerunt combusti ut haeretici in Constancia, tempore
consilii Constanciensis, ut dixit mini doctori Gascoiyne bonae memoriae
