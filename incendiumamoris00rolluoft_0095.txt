JOHN NEWTON 6 5

John Newton‚ one of the founders of the Mercer‘s Gild at
York. This “ Gild of Blessed Mary ” 1 was founded about
the middle of the fourteenth century, and was the owner of
the still existent “ Merchant’s Hall'’: later on, it became
the “ Gild of the Holy Trinity.'‘ Though the relationship
of the two John Newton’s is not proved, the fact that the
later John N ewton received so much ecclesiastical promotion
at York renders it likely that the two were related. The
name Newton is common at York, but it is unlikely that
there were two separate families of so great municipal
importance as those to which both men belonged.

Newton‚ the treasurer and student of Rolle, studied law
at Cambridge, and became acquainted there with the two
men who were to be his patrons in after life, and successive
archbishops of York, Richard Scrope and Thomas Arundel.
In 1377 Scrope was bishop Arundel’s official at ΕΙγ,2 and
he was succeeded in that office by Newton on 20
September, 1379.3 The connexion between Newton‚
Scrope and Arundel remained close throughout their
lives, for when Arundel was translated from Ely
to York, he made Newton his official ⁴ and vicar

on business connected wgith the obtaining of the Gild Chartef, and the
Gild paid him 40s. for expenses.) There are also references to William
