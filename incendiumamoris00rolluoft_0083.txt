SPOFFORTH AT CONSTANCE 53

one of the presidents of that provincial chapter held at
Petershausen in 1417, which played so important a part in
German Benedictine reform. It is possible that the monkl
who was afterwards his chaplain attended him as part of
his retinue, and was one of the 373 Benedictine monks
mentioned as present at that chapter23 and that Spofforth
and the chapter of Petershausen were the means of com-
munication by which Rolle's Incendium Amoris travelled
to the Continent; at any rate, an admirer of the Incendium
had considerable intercourse with an assembly which must
have included some interested in Continental mystics.
Braystones' interest in the Incendium is indicated, not only
by his application for the grant of the Indulgence to its
readers, but by his passage from the Benedictines to the
strictly contemplative Carthusian order. While his own
admiration for Rolle is clear, that of Spofforth his patron
is implied not merely by the association between the two
men, but also by other Rolle MSS. These shew that Rolle
was popular at York, and among those in touch with
S. Mary's, while Spofforth was abbot there.3 As ambas—
sador at Constance, Spofforth seems to have taken no

real field of his activities was the adjacent abbey of Peters-
hausen.4 The chapter held there was ordered by the
fathers of Constance themselves, to promote the internal

either in the episcopal registers at, York, or in the Cartulary of S. Mary’s,
a transcripta of which was very kindly lent me by Dr. F arrer. The village
of Braystones was, however, situatecl near S. Bees, a cell of S. Mary’s
Abbey, and the Cartulary of S. Bees is still preserved as· Harl. MS„ 434.
The name of ‘Ricardus de Braystans’ occurs five times as witness to ,
charters conferring land on the priory of S. Bees (ff. 114, 115, 117), and
once as the trustee 10 whom a certain ⁴ Michaelus Stayngref ’ transferred all
his land in Cumberland, in trust for ‘ohe abbo‘o of S. Mary's, York. One
of the charters is dated 1389, and from the connexion of Richard Braystones
with S. Bees and S. Mary’s, it seems likely that it was his son who became
{he mgnk of S. Mary’s, and obtained the grant of the indulgence for the
