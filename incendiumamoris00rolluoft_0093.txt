(5) EVIDENCE OF Emmanuel College MS. 35=(j), As TO THE
RELATIONSHIP OF THE LONG AND SHORT TExrs OF THE
Incendium AmoriS, AND LIFE OF 1Ts OWNER, JOHN
NEWTON.

The most important MS. evidence as to the authenticity
of the long text is that of (j). The book contains the last
half of Rolle's Comment on the Canticles, three other tracts
of Rolle‘s,2 then the short text of the Incendium, in a very
confused order, and then some Other tracts of S. Augustine‚
S. Bonaventura, and Rolle. The end of the Incendium, is
followed by a note “Hic correctus per librum quern sanctus
Ricardus de H. propria manu scripsit,’'3 and the same
hand has most carefully copied into the margin, or on inter-
polated sheets, all those passages of the long text which are
omitted in the short text3 and in two cases, i.e. of the two
Chapters included in the passages usually found in connex-
ion with the Comment on the cannales, as in this MS„ the
direction is given, “require cap. duodecim in tractatu qui
dicitur Oleum effusum‚“ etc. The long text was thus

⁷ completely restored ‘⁴ from the book which Saint Richard

of Hampole wrote with his own hand,'' but as the confused
order of the text made the book still very difficult to read,
a table of chapter headings4 was copied On f. 59, prefaced

1. The early printed editions of Rolle's Latin works are obviously
printed from a manuscript containing only the selected passages, S, of
the Incendium.. See p. xxi.

2. See pp. 13, 14. 3. See p. 14,

4. It is unlikely that these chapter headings are Rolle’s own work,
since they are only found in two out of the fifteen MSS. of the long
text, and since they are obviously summaries of the contents of the
chapters, written afterwards, and not a scheme prepared beforehand.
Rolle’s other Latin treatises also, which are similar in subject and construc-
tion to the Incendium, have no chapter headings or formal plan (8.9. The
De Amore Dei contra amatores mundi, the Melum Contemplatinormn and
the Comment on the Canticles, which are often found in the MSS. in close
connexion with the Incendium.) Rolle’s Emendacio Uita, on the other
hand, has chapter headings, and several MSS. use this fact to
distinguish it from his other works, by giving it the title of The Twelve
Chapters, cf. (a), (x).
