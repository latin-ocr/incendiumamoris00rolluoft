DOUBLE ORDERS 95

The account of the foundation given in the latter manuscript
differs noticeably in some respects from the evidence of
the foundation charterl of Sion, and through comparison
with certain Swedish records has proved to be justified.
There is no reason to doubt, however, that the directions
in the foundation charter for the constitution of the new
monastery were substantially carried out. As with all
double orders, the aim of combining convents of men and
women under the same roof was to secure for the nuns the
ministrations of priests professed in the same order, who
should be also better able to supervise the finances of the
community and travel in its behalf. Thus the proportions
of men and women at Sion were not to be equal, but the
community was to -consist of sixty sisters, including the
abbess, and twenty-five brothers, including the confessor.
The relative numbers show, however, that the brothers at
Sion were not primarily a staff of chaplains for the sisters‚
as in Gilbertine foundations: they had a fine library and
included several scholars of repute‚ including the liturgio-
logist‚ Clement Maidstone,2 the chief fifteenth century
authority on the Sarum Use.

The obscurities of Sion history include an attempt to
found a Brigittine community in England before 1415. In
the years preceding and during the -council of Constance,
S. Bridget was perhaps the most popular northern saint of
the day; her new order impressed contemporaries with its
enthusiasm and asceticism, and reverence for the saint
naturally centred in Sweden. When Philippa, the daughter
of Henry IV of England, became Queen of Sweden in
1406, admiration for S. Bridget spread to England through
the medium of a gentleman of Philippa’s retinue, Sir Henry
FitzHugh, baron of Ravensworth.3 The Sion Martiloge
describes the latter as “primus qui introduxit hanc
religionem in regnum Anglie‚‘'4 and he is known to political
