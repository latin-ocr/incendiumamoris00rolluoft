80 JOAN SEWELL

(ffi- and ff), and one or other of these monograms

occurs again on twelve other folios,1 in the margins of the
Incendium and Rolle’s De Amore Dei contra Amatores
Mundi. The only other words in this writing are
“Sewellam . . .'' (renue P) on folio 174, and a marginal
note “contra prelatos‚’‘ against a passage where Rolle
denounces the pride and vanity of ecclesiastircs. There are,
however, several elaborate “Nota's‚’‘ sometimes written
in the form of a monogram,

A similar monogram is found in (a), a British museum
manuscript of the Incendium. 2 This is a long text, and the
scribe has drawn a line against the first passage found in
the long text, but omitted in the short text, and marked it
with a monogram drawn in a similar way to those in the
Emmanuel manuscript, but with the three letters combined,

J.G.S. ( ). The scribe must have been acquainted with

the short text in order to make the annotation: or more
probably she had a short text at hand, with which she was
comparing the British Museum manuscript. The word
“ Reclusa ’' seems to have been here loosely used to denote
a member of an enclosed community. Joan Sewell was a
Brigittine sister of Henry V’s royal abbey of Sion: she
was professed in 1500, 3 and the Martiloge of Sion abbey
records that she died on July 2, 1532, and was buried
among the other sisters “ iuxta gerras‚’' 4——near the screen
which shut off part of the chapel. The Brigittine was a
double order, and the brothers and sisters at Sion had
separate libraries: the catalogue of the brothers' library
still exists, and has been published by Miss Bateson.⁵
