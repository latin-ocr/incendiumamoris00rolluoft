NON DISPUTANDO SED AMANDO SCIETUR 41

I marvelled‚when that flame first burst forth in my soul, and
was in unwonted peace, through the unexpectedness of this
abundance ..... For I had not reckoned that such a
warmth could happen to any man in this exile ..... for
even as a finger, placed in the fire, is clothed with heat
which it feels, so the soul, kindled in this manner, as Ι 113ν6
told, is sensible of the most real heat3 but now fiercer and
greater, now less, even as the frailty of the flesh allows. . . ·
Therefore I offer this book to the sight,—not of philoso-
phers and wise men of the world, nor 01 great theologians
wrapped in endless questionings‚ but 01 1116 simple and
untaught, those who seek to love God rather than to know
many things. For not by disputing, but by doing is He
known, and by loving ..... Wherefore, because here Ι
1116116 311 10 1ον6, and I shall seek to explain the burning
and supernatural feeling 01 1ον6, 161 11115 book be allotted
the title 01 Fire os Love.'’

The book 115611 takes sorry-two chapters to accomplish
this end, and is quite without the structural plan, so dear
to mediaeval writers, and in particular to S. Bonaventura.
It 15, indeed, rather a series 01 discourses on subjects con-
nected with the 1116 01 the solitary than a complete didactic
scheme. In the Prologue, Rolle states his own desire to
prove to others the joy 01 1116 1116 he had himself chosen;
the next eleven Chapters are devoted to considerations
preliminary to the undertaking 01 such a life3 then come
two Chapters1 where he passes from advice to autobio-
graphy and which contain most of the passages quoted by
the Hampole nuns in the office. The remaining chapters
are mainly a series 01 discourses strung together with no
particular plan, on the various difficulties 01 1116 contempla-
tive 1116, interspersed with prayers and meditations which
are the Latin counterpart of Rolle's better known Middle
English work. There is a great deal 01 repetition, and a
good deal 01 fairly commonplace mediaeval sermon: but
