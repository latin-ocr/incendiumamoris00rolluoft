as master for the year beginning 29 Sept„ 1380.l During
his mastership, 1380—97, Newton must have spent much of
his time at Ely up to the year 1390, after which date he lived
at York‚ occupied with the duties of official, vicar general
and treasurer of the cathedral‚ but the college reckons him
among the earliest of its benefactors. He sent a parcel of
books from York to Cambridge two years before his death,2
and bequeathed eighteen volumes to it in his will.3 The
college still possesses a manuscript catalogue of its library
in 1418‚4 and this mentions three books-‘² given by John
Newton, all of which are at present in the library, and two
of which occur among the eighteen volumes bequeathed
in Newton’s will. The detailed references in the latter to
imperfect or unfinished manuscripts, and to “tables of
contents” of the books, shew Newton’s knowledge of his
own library and his scholarly care for texts3 and the Peter-
house compotus roll for the first year of his mastership has
an interesting entry “ for paper and parchment for rolls and
quaterni, '' among the usual housekeeping accounts.6

1. The roll, kindly shown me by Dr. Walker, is headed‘ Compotus

magistro domus sancti Petri Cantabrig ie . . . a festo sancti Micheli
archangeli anno domini M0 CCC⁰ LXXX‘} usque in uigiliam sancti Michelis
anno reuoluto‚’' and the reference to the pension is “Item de xls. solutis
magistro domus pro pensione sua totuis anni.” This conflicts with the
statement of Le Neve, Fasti, iii, 668, that Newton was admitted 3 March
