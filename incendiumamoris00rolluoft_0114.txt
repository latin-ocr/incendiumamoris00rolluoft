84 EXTERNAL EV1DENcE

again where he returns to the subject of the contemplative,
or solitary, life, the thought in the short text appears more
continuous than in the long. But the Incendium is a long
and rambling work, with a great deal of repetition in the
last chapters; and the author of the abridgment became
careless in his selection after going through about two-
thirds of the manuscript3 the omitted passages1 appear here
to have been chosen at random, and at the end of chapters
28 and 29 the scribe in three cases did not finish the
sentence he was copying, but writing “ etc.'’ turned over a
page or two of the manuscript, and began again. This
occurs only 3 times out of the 39 omitted passages, but 8
out of the 1 1 short text MSS. write etc. at these places,2 and
the other three probably only omitted it in copying. In
other places also, where the abridgment becomes merely
‹careless at the end of the book, the scribe began his new
paragraph with ‘⁶ Item‚'’ where the long text has no such
word. The occurrence of these “etos'’ and “items''
prove beyond a doubt that the short text is an abridgment,
in spite of the delusive continuity of the short text in its
earlier portions.

A comparison of the passages omitted in the short text
with th( se retained shews that the scribe who made the
abridgment was not interested in Rolle‘s autobiography
or in those passages of exhortation and warning which he
might have addressed to seculars‚ but in the many passages
in the book where Rolle speaks of contemplation and the
contemplative life. The omitted passages are printed in
the text of this edition within heavy brackets, and a study

of them, together with the list here following, will confirm
this statement,
