TWO BULLS FOR SION 127

undated, and though evidently drawn up before the news
of the retirement of Alnwick and Matilda Newton had
reached Sweden‚ was probably presented afterwards, some
time before August 1418. In the supplica Henry asks for
the ratification of the foundation of Sion,1 and of his
appointment of William Alnwick and Matilda Newton as
father and mother at Sion.2 and that they may transfer
themselves to the order of S. Saviour, admit to profession
either seculars or the religious of any order, and share
with the community in the indulgences of the whole order.
Henry also asks that the Brigittine rule ³ and the canonisa-
tion of S. Bridget,4 confirmed during the schism, may be
respectively confirmed. ’

In answer Martin V issued at Geneva two bulls, both
dated 18 August 1418. One, Eximie deuociom's,⁵ printed
by Dugdale and Rymer, is addressed to Henry himself,
and states that since Henry has devoutly wished to found a
monastery of S. Saviour at Sion, and other monasteries of
that order in England, and since he has wished to endow
Sion with the advowsons of the parish churches of Yeovil
and Croston, the pope hereby appropriates and incorpor-
ates‚ annexes and unites these churches in part dower to
Sion; directions follow concerning the maintenance of
suitable vicars by the abbess of Sion. The other bull,
Integre deuociom‘s, was addressed to the archbishop of
Canterbury‚ the bishop of London, and the abbot of S.
Albans, and has been copied in the Swedish royal archives
in the text of an open letter of Richard Clifford, bishop of
London, publishing the bull to the faithful at the request
of the abbess and convent of Sion.6 The preface to this
bull, about one-fifth of the whole letter, recapitulates the
contents of the first bull: “ Since in answer to the petition
of Henry V we have appropriated and incorporated,
annexed and united the parish churches of Yeovil and
Croston to Sion, as is more fully set forth in other letters '
