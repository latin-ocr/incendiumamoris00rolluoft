PSEUDO-DIONYSIUS 59

Victor had translated the De Mystica Theologia of the latter
into Latin, and Grossetete himself had written a translation
and commentary on the same work, of which the comment-
ary at least was original; but the fact that he had done so
seems to shew that the earlier translation of Hugh of S.
Victor was not very generally known. It is doubtful
whether the works of Dionysius obtained a first-hand
influence in England much before their translation into
English by an unknown fifteenth century scribe.l S. Bona-
ventura frequently quoted Dionysius, and it is probable that
Rolle obtained what knowledge he had of Dionysius from
him and similar writers. Rolle refers occasionally to
successive orders of angels, but rather, probably, in accord-
ance with current mediaeval theology than with direct
reference to the Celestial Hiemrchy of Dionysius. There
is no reference in the Incendium to the “ negative method ”
of contemplation, which is such a prominent feature in the
teaching of Dionysius, and which is recommended by
Bonaventura in the De Tripvlici Via, cap. 3. “ Sed alia
(via) est eminentior,‘’ he sayS, “scilicet secundum viam
negationis, quoniam, ut dicit Dionysius, ‘ affirmationes
incompactae sunt, negationes verae,’ licet enim minus vide-
· antur dicere, plus dicunt.”2 ‘There is nothing so philo-
sophical as this in the Incendium.

„ Thus, as regards Rolle’s sources, it is difficult to prove
that he was directly influenced by any particular school of
mysticism, although the thought and language of the
Incendium approach more nearly to Hugh of S. Victor’s
works, and especially the Soliloquium de Arrha Animae,
than to either those of S. Bonaventura, S. Bernard or

Dionysius. Such influence as these latter had upon him

1. Camb. Univ. Lib. MS„ Kk. 6, 26, contains an English translation of
the De Mystica Τήεοίορία, and the Little Pisae of Prii-y Counsel and the
Little Pisae on Prayer. These latter tracts are deeply influenced by
Dionysius, and their beaching is very far removed from Rolle’s. (Cf. also
