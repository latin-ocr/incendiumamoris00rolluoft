THE SWEDISH SISTERS 107

consecrated sisters‚ well instructed in the observances of the
sule, with one brother, a priest‚ and two maidens, suitable
for the choir and singing.'' They entreat Henry to treat
them favourably, according to his promise, “ together with
our two brothers sent at the request of the lord Henry of
happy memory, your most dear father, at another time‚” ¹
—a sentence which shews that the two brothers, John
Peterson and Katillus, were still in England. The
Vadstena Diary states that in Nlay, 1415, “ at the request
of the king of England, and of the king and queen of
Sweden, there went forth four consecrated sisters‚ namely,
Christina Finwidds dottir, Ragnildis Tideka dotus, and
Anna and Christina Esbiorna dottir‚ with three maidens
not consecrated3 with whom also there went at the same
time, br. John of Kalmar and dom. Magnus Hemmingson‚
to begin the spreading of our order in England. And these
persons were led forth with great solemnity by the arch-
bishop of Lund, and all the Swedish bishops, and one from
Norway, and a host of knights and solemn messengers.’' 2
Of these sisters‚ Christina Finwids dottir had entered the
order in 138623 Anna (Karls dottir) in 14OO‚4 while Ragnildis
Tideka dottir's profession is not known. Christina Esbiorna
had been educated by Cecilia‚ daughter of S. Bridget
herself, and had been professed in 1400, and the names of
all the sisters occur in the Sion Martiloge.

The little party of Brigittines arrived at King’s Lynn‚5
and probably proceeded to the building at Twickenham,
which had been begun in February, five months before.
There they were joined, sometime before 1418, by postulants
from different religious houseS,6 as is shewn by Henry’s

l. Dsplonuztarium, iii, 2082.

6. It was the Brigittine custom that postulants should live for a year
near the monastery, coming there at intervals for instruction from a “sad
and discreet sister-,⁵² As the Swedish sisters had been sent to instruct the
new community, however, it is probable that many of the postulants lived
at Sion for some time before the “first profession '' of 1420.
