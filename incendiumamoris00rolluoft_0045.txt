EMMANUEL MS. 35 15

of the single words where the short text differs from the
long text, and where (j) has individual slips.)

The MS. seems to have been written by two hands, that
of the Oleum at the beginning, and that of ff. 25-58b‚=
part of the long text of the Incendium (these are quite
distinct from Newton’s hand). Of these two:

ff. 2-24b. (Oleum, and Chapters 12, 15, etc., of Incendium, the
ludica me deus, and Mulierem fortem)

ff. 63-163b. (The short text of Incendium; AugustinuS‚ De uera
uita ,· Bonaventura, Meditaciones imaginis uite)

ff 195-204. (Beginning of the Melum contemplatiuorum)
are in the hand os the Oleum; and the folios in the second
hand include

fl. 25—58b. (Part of long text of Incendium.)

ff. 61-62b. (Exposicio oracionis dominice.)

ff. 164-192. (The De amore dei contra amatores mundi.)

ff. 204-235. (The end of the Melum contemplatiuorum.)

An interesting feature of this manuscript is the signa-
ture at the bottom of f. 22, in a sixteenth century hand,
“Sewella Sionita Reclusa.'' (See Introd.‚pp. 79-83.) Mono-
grams in the same hand occur on several folios; on f. 21b
J. S. and J. G. (J. S. for Joanna Sewella‚ and J. G. for
James Greenhalgh),l while the monogram J. G. occurs
also on ff. 22, 169, 171, 173, 174, 175, 175b‚ 176b, 1801), 182,
183, 184, 188, 1881), 190. The same hand has also written
on f. 174 “Sewellam zenue '² (or renue ?), on f. 175b,
relative to a passage in the text, “ Contra prelatos '’; and
on ff. 183, 191, an elaborately drawn NOTA.
