PREFACE.

THE English works of Richard Rolle‚ the fourteenth
century hermit‚ poet and mystic‚ have already received
much attention from students of Middle English Litera-
ture, both for the beauty of his lyrics and prose treatises,
and from linguistic interest in the northern dialect in
which they are written. Rolle, however, wrote as freely
in Latin as in English, but his Latin treatises have been
allowed to remain in manuscript ; of these‚the Incendium
Amoris is perhaps the most important and representative.
These treatises were of less general interest than the
Middle English works; they had no linguistic interest,
and much less literary value, since the mediaeval Latin
in which they were written was a less good vehicle of
expression than English for the peculias beauty of
Rolle's style. Their subject was also of much narrower
interest, since they dealt almost solely with the contem-
plative life, while Rolle's exhortations in the vernaculas
were often addressed to the devout laity, and covered a
much wider range of topics. The class of people who
in Rolle’s day would have been naturally interested in
the Latin treatises was thus a small one: it was repre-
sented chiefly by the recluse or hermit, and the members
of contemplative religious orders. In modern times
scholars have approached mediaeval literature so much
from the linguistic point of view, that they have perhaps
been unduly incurious as to the value of such writings
as Rolle's Latin works as illustrations of mediaeval ideals,
practice and atmosphere.

Two additional reasons must have tended from the first
to limit the already select public, and to account for the
limited popularity of the prose treatises in the centuries
immediately succeeding Rolle‘s death, and their non-
publication in modern times. The first was the quite
undeserved suspicion of heresy which clung to Rolle's
