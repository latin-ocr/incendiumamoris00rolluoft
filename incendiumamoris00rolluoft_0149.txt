THE RECLUSE OF WESTMINSTER 119

1418 to procure the confirmation of the Brigittine indulg-
ences for Sion :1 the foundation of the monastery appears
to owe more to him than to any other priest‚ and the
Vadstena letter of 18 August, 1418, addressed to the priest
who was sheltering the community at Sion “under the
special mantle of his protection ” was probably intended
for him. In 1415 he may not have been considered of
sufficient standing to receive the royal appointment,2 but in
1420 he was elected as first confessor by the community,
which understood his labours on its behalf.·⁹’

The relative positions of Alnwick and Fishbourn as
confessor nominated and confessor elected are thus clear:
but who was William Alnwick, “ recluse monk of West-
minster ”P Information concerning the anchorets or
recluses of Westminster occurs in Miss Clay's book on
Hermits. William Alnwick “ was one of a long succession
of anchorites connected with the abbey, who dwelt in a cell
on the south side of the chancel of S. Margaret's. Nicholas
the Hermit occurs as early as 1242—5,4 and Richard ΙΙ
visited S. Edward's shrine at Westminster, and confessed
himself to the anchoret in 1381.” 5 There is a curious refer-
ence to a recluse of Westminster in 1397, and this man may
have been Alnwick himself (since the S. Albans chronicler
says he died of “old age and weariness‘' about 1417).
Thomas Beauchamp-, earl of Warwick‚ when accused of
treason, after the execution of the earl of Arundel, was
brought before parliament, and confessed that what he had

done was by the counsel of the duke of Gloucester and earl
of Arundel :⁶
