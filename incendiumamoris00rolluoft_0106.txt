76 LIFE OF NEWTON

were placed in the newly finished cathedral library. The
account roll of Nicholas Keld for 28 December, 1421-2, has
an entry: “Johanni Upton pro superscriptura librorum
nuper magistri Johannis Neuton thesaurarii istius ecclesiae
legatorum librariae, 2s. Thomae Horner de Petergate pro
hornyng et naillyng superscriptorum librorum 25. 6d.
Radulpho Lorymer de Conyngstrete pro factura et emenda-
cione xl cathenarum pro eiusdem libris annexis in libraria
predicta. 235. 1d.” Newton's books were evidently
“horned and nailed '' by “Thomas the Horner,’' and
chained by “ Ralph the chain-smith,“ in exactly the
manner of the manuscript of the Incendium in Hereford
cathedral library,l i.e., the name of the book was written
on a small parchment label‚ and covered with a thin sheet
of transparent horn, nailed probably to the wooden cover
of the manuscript. It is interesting to see that none of the
forty books left in the will had been lost as yet, because the
number of chains correspond3 and since the entry does not
mention “ horns and chains '³ for any other books, it is
likely that Newton's bequest formed in 1421 the bulk of the
new library.2

Except for one or two posthumous references in the
Patent Rolls, these entries in the York Fabric Rolls are the
last references to Newton. Throughout his life he had
been a scholar and a book-lover, and at his death
he left an exceptionally fine library. His death in
1414 dates the short text of the Incendium as at any rate
prior to that year; and since it is unlikely, from internal
evidence, that his manuscript was the original short text, or
that he made the emendations as a very old man, this
brings the date of the short text well back into the four-
teenth century.

Newton’s interest in the Incendium raises the question
of his possible relations with two contemporaries: Chris-
topher Braystones, the monk, who later obtained the
