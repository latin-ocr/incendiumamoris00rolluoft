LIBRARY AT SION 81

Neither of the Incendium manuscripts formed part of it at
the time that the catalogue was written: but it is possible
that one or both of them formed part of the sisters' library.
The catalogue of the brothers’ library mentions five Ham-
pole manuscripts, of which one, a great treasure‚ was
described as Melos Contemplacionis Ricasrdz· Hampole et
dicitur propria manu scripsisse librum. The five Hampole
manuscripts included one of Rolle's Incendium, but the
description in the catalogue does not apply to either of the
existent manuscripts in which sister Joan wrote her mono-
gram. The Brigittine rule does not mention a library, but
required “that the brethren and sisters should have books
necessary for the performance of divine service, and of no
other kind, except for learning and study.'' But both at
Sion and at Vadstena, the parent house of the Brigittine
order, the clause concerning “books for learning and
study '' seems to have received a wide interpretation. The
convent at Vadstena has been described as “the great
centre of Swedish literary activity before the Reforma-
tion ’' 1; at its fall in 1540 it had a fine library, the
manuscripts of which are now scattered in various Swedish
and Norwegian collections. One of the Swedish brothers
sent from Vadstena to aid in the foundation of a Brigittine
house in England‚ is mentioned in the Vadstena Diary as
having returned in 1416 from England‚ where “multa
quoque bona reliquit in scriptis et libris ’‘; and the Sion
Martiloge, and “Addamus'' to the Rule at Sion have
several references to the library, and to donors of books.
The librarians were responsible for the saying of prayers
for the donors of books, and the Additions ordered that the
bishop should “ enquire if there be an inventory or register
of books of the library, and how they and other books of
study be kept and repaired;'’⁷ they also enjoined that
“ Silence after some convenience is to be kept in the library‚
whyls any suster is there alone in recordyng of her
redinge.‘’
