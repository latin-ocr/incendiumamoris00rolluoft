viii. PREFACE

York 1393—1414. In one of these notes he stated that
he had emended the Incendium Amoris, as originally
written in the manuscript, from the book which Saint
Richard of Hampole wrote with his own hand. This
suggested that Emmanuel MS. 35 was therefore of
primary importance for the study of the text of the
Incendium Amoris, as to which Miss Allen saw that the
manuscripts shewed great confusion. Her note on the
subject of Emmanuel MS. 35 was published by the
Athenaeum, 23 Aug„ 1913.

My own study of the Incendium Amoris was suggested
hy Miss Allen, and was based on the list of the manu-
scripts of the Incendium Amoris, very kindly supplied
to me by her. It has been confined to working out the
text, and to the endeavour to trace the history of the text
from the ownership of the various manuscripts. I found
that the manuscripts, exclusive of those which contained
merely fragments, conformed to two types, a longer and
a shorter‚ that the longer type must have been Rolle's
original text, and that the shorter was an abridgment.
Emmanuel MS. 35 was an abridged text, which had been
restored to its original form by John Newton, a book-
collector and very careful scribe. Newton’s emendations
proved the short text to have been written some time
before his own death in 1414, and render Emmanuel MS.
35 authoritative for the original form of the text. As
the emended manuscript agrees substantially with the
better long text manuscripts, it also establishes their
validity.

My interest in the ownership of manuscripts of the
Incendium Amoris led me in one case rather far afield,
with negative results so far as the history of the text was
concerned. This was in the case of the connexion of
Sion abbey with two manuscripts of the Incendium
Amoris: one, the above-mentioned Emmanuel MS. 35,
the manuscript of John Newton, the other, British
Museum Additional MS. 24,661. I noticed in both these
