50 S. BONAVENTURA

in his writings that he was acquainted with the confusion
between the Incendium and the De Triplici Via.

Comparing the Incendium with Bonaventura's writings
on the same subject, Ι can find no resemblance. Rolle’s
rambling and diffuse style is as far removed as possible
from Bonaventura’s carefulness of design, and lucidity of
expression. Bonaventura’s De Triplici Via, which through
the above-named confusion was till recently known also as
the Incendium Amoris, deals‚ like Rolle's with the stages of
the contemplative life: but the lack of design in Rolle’s
work contrasts strongly with Bonaventura's divisions and
sub-divisions: his three degrees of prayer, six degrees of
perfection, seven steps respectively towards the attainment
of peace, truth and love, etc. The rhythm also of Rolle's
long, involved sentences differs greatly from Bonaventura’s
careful pauses, and balanced antitheses. In their respective
outlook, Rolle and Bonaventura differ even more widely:
while Rolle revolted against the scholastic method of his
day, Bonaventura accepted it fully and expressed himself
by its means.l Thus while Rolle in the Incendium speaks
of the three stages in his own spiritual life, he uses the terms
“ feruor,'’ “canor,” “ dulcor,” which are drawn from his
own experience, and can only roughly be equated with
those used by other mystics. They certainly do not corres-
pond with the three stages of “purgation,'’ “illumination‚’'
and “union’‘ of the normal mediaeval scheme. Bonaven-
tura, however, adopted this traditional division in the De
Triplici Via, and elaborated it. Thus in neither style nor
thought can the Incendium be said to have derived much
from Bonaventura.

There is, however, an interesting confusion between
Rolle’s Incendium Amoris and Bonaventura’s De Triplici
Via, due to the occurrence of the last part of Rolle‘s
Prologue (“ Euigilans uero animam meam . . . . iscius
libri titulus incendium amoris sorciatur ’')‚ in a few late
Bonaventura MSS. Rolle's Prologue is an autobiogra-
phical note, describing his own mystical exp'erience, and
