(2) SUBJECT MATTER OF THE INCENDmM.

The life of Richard Rolle of Hampole‚ the author of this
treatise‚ has been treated by Dr. C. Horstman in his
Richard Rolle of Hampole and his followers‚1 and more
recently, though more shortly, by Miss Hope Allen, in a
monograph on the Authorship os the Prick of conscience.2
The monograph deals with the subject of the general biblio-
graphy of Rolle, but does not go at length into the question
of his life: this however will be dealt with in Miss Allen's
forthcoming work, entitled A Descriptive Catalogue of the
Works of Richard Rolle of Hampole, which will render a
formal biography of Rolle here unnecessary. We are
dependent for the dates of Rolle's birth and death on notes
in the manuscripts of some of his works, and for the other
facts of his life upon some autobiographical passages in
the Incendium Amoris,3 which were introduced into his
office. 4 Though Rolle was never canonized, this office was
compiled in readiness for that eventuality by the Hampole
nuns with whom he passed the last years of his life. The
outline, as supplied by these sources, is familiar: Rolle
