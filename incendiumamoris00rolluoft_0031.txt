BRITISH MUSEUM.

A.—Full Texts. Addit. MS. 24, 661=(a).

Quarto, vellum 9{‡in. by 7in. Sec. XV early. The
manuscript belonged to Arch. Tenison’s Library‚1 then
to the Parish Library of S. Martin’s, Castle Street‚
Westminster3 and was sold by S. Leigh Sotheby and
John Wilkinson, July 1, 1861. The description of the
MS„ numbered 41 in the sale catalogue, is sufficient
to prove the identity. The MS. is clearly written,
probably by an English scribe, since the exclamation
“Lady Helpe'’ occurs after the title of the third

treatise.

diuiditur in duodecim capitula. Ne tardes conuerti ad
dominum . . . .

and independent version of the long text follows. Chap-
ters 12 and 15 are present, but towards the end of the
treatise many passages are omitted. These, however, have
no relation to the omitted passages in the short text, or
to the omissions in any MS. of the Incendium.)

f. 48b. Dulciorem uoluptatem non cognosco. (zcap. 42 of Incen-
dium, to . . . perficiendo quod preparasti, p. 278. Then
more passages from the earlier part of the Incendium
follow, till f. 5819.)
