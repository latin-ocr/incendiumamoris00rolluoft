48 THE RECLusE LIFE

In chapter 13 Rolle speaks of the relative worthiness of
life in a community, and as a solitary. “There are some,''
he says, “ who rank life in a community far higher than the
life of a hermit, and say that we ought all to hasten to join
a community if we wish to reach the highest perfection.
With these men we have little cause of dispute, because
they merely praise that life which they desire to lead, or at
any rate with which they have some acquaintance. For
there is a life which no man living in the flesh can know,
except him to whom it is granted by God to lead it, and
surely no man may judge rightly of this matter, while he as
yet knows not what it is and in what manner it is led. Most
surely I know, that if they learned to know it, they would
praise it more than other men. Others err more greatly,
for they cease not to blame and slander the hermit life, and
say, ‘Woe to him who is alone.' They do not explain
‘alone ’ as meaning ‘ without God) but as ‘ without com-
rade’ ε for that man is alone, with whom God is not ..... ’
For to him who chooses the hermit life for God’s sake, and
leads it rightly: to him it shall be, not ‘Woe' but
‘Winsorne virtue.⁷ Moreover‚ as far as I could read in
the Scriptures‚ I found and learnt that the highest love of
Christ consists in three things: in beat, and song, and
sweetness13 and these three, I found in my own mind,
cannot long remain without great qui-et.'' 2 “ In the
wilderness indeed they are more clearly present: for there
the beloved speaks to the heart, even as a bashful lover,
who does not caress his love before all men, nor does he
kiss her as his friend, but only in the common manner, as

a stranger.’'

The question of the influence upon Rolle of other mystics
cannot be satisfactorily answered by a study of the Incen-
