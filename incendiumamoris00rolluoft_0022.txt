CONTENTS

An instruction on the contemplative life through
prayer, medstation, fasting and watching; and
of the proud and the true contemplatives, and
true melodious song

That spiritual song agrees not with bodily; and
the cause and error of those who deny this;
and of knowledge inshed and inspired, how it
differs from that laboriously gained

Of the exceeding excellence of melodious song,
and that it cannot be told or written down, nor
hath it any fellow; and of the love of those
who sing, and the pride of those who have
laboriously gained knowledge -

A meditation oi him that saints for the beloved,
and the lack of all fellowsliip; and how in due
order he comes to the fire of love

Of the different gifts of the elect, and how the
saints advanced in love by prayer, meditation,
affection, bearing missortunes and hating sins ;
and that love comes forth from God, and that
continual thought of Him is necessary to a
lover; nor does a lover fall into temptations of
the flesh as others who are not yet perfect; nor
is he injured through the smouldering spark
of sin, though it remains

That the true lover loveth his beloved alone, and
of two manners of ecstasy, without the body,
and through the raising up of the mind into
God, and of the excellence of the second

The desire of the lover for God is explained, and
the love of the world is shewn to be hateful by
many examples ; and that the continual thought
of God does not dwell in lovers of the world -

Of the many kinds of friendship between good
and bad men, and whether it can be dissolved.
Of seclusion, and the friendships of men and
women. Of true friendship, and how the elect
rejoice in it upon the way of liie; and of the
foolishness of certain men who fast too straitly,
or go naked; and of fleshly friendship and the
finery oi men and women - -
