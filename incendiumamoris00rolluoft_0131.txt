CHERRY HINTON 101

completed the number of eighty-five provided for by the
charter of foundation.'' Other writers1 have suggested
that the two Brigittines founded their community at Fitz
Hugh's manor of Cherry Hinton, near Cambridge. The
statement of the Sion Martiloge does not, however, justify
this theory. It says of Fitz Hugh : “ He was the first who
introduced this order into the kingdom of England3 and
he supported certain brothers of this order, sent from
Vadstena to begin this, for many years at his own cost3
and as part of the dower of this monastery he gave his
demesne and manos of Hinton in the county of Cambridge.
And at his death he bequeathed 2620 to be faithfully paid
in addition to« the aforesaid manor, which is worth ,4⁴20 in
yearly rent. Therefore he is justly reckoned among the
first and special benefactors.’‘2

The English evidence against the existence of a pre-1415
community at Cherry Hinton is, however, much stronger.
The Sion Martiloge calls the great 1420 profession “the
first in England'’: “Anno domini 1420, uicesimo die
mensis aprilis . . . . celebrata erat prima professio ordinis
sancti Saluatoris de Sion in regno Anglie per manus
uenerabilis patris domini Henrici Chicheley Cantuariensis
archiepiscopi ”; and besides thus ignoring the profession
of Matilda Newton and Alnwick‚ as mentioned in the
foundation charter, it does not even include thern in the
Obit Book as professed Brigittines at all.3 It is, moreover‚
difficult to see how so informal a beginning could have been
made at the moated farm-house, which in 1408 formed the
nucleus of Fitz Hugh’s manor of Up-Halle‚4 at Cherry
Hinton, or how the two brothers could have started a double
monastery without special buildings. The local records
have no reference to the stay of the two Brigittines at
