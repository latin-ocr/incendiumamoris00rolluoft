THE FOUNDATION OF SION ABBEY.

As the present English monographs on Sion abbey either
leave the foundation and early years of the community in
great obscurity‚ or adopt an unsatisfactory theory to explain
the difficulties in the English records‚ it seems worth while
to append a short account of the foundation of this royal
abbey.

The books on the subject at present most accessible to
English readers are G. J. Aungier’s History and Antiqui-
ties of Syon Monastery,1 and the Introduction to J. H.
Blunt’s edition of the Myroure os oure chd'ye.2 A far more
exhaustive study is Dr. Torvald’s Ho‘jer’s Studier i Vad-
stena Klostesrs och Birgittinordens Historia, which adds to
the evidence the result of research among the Swedish
Royal Archives‚ and various MSS. in the Upsala Univer-
sity Library. This Swedish work is, however, inaccessible
to most English readers, and was only studied by the writer
through the kindness of the present Lady Abbess of Sion,3
for whom a partial translation had been made by Miss
Howitt. Dr. Ho'jer, however, being primarily interested in
the foundation of Sion as part of the history of a Swedish
saint and her work, has not referred to certain English

is its foundation in 1415 by Henry V, as a monastery
for men and women living according to the “ Rule of
