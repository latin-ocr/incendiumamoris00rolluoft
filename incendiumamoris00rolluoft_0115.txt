INTERNAL EvaNcE 85

The thought of the long text is here more continuous.
pp. 1603. [Abundancia—cruce] Nihil enim . . . .

The omitted passage is a digression, a theological dis-
course on the Trinity. The short text is therefore more

continuous.
p. 164. [quippe—caritas] et soli . . . .

Here the scribe obviously copied the passages relating to

contemplation.
pp. 164—70 [Et quidem—laudant] Risus igitur . . . .

The scribe probably copied the “Risus’' passage because
Rolle‘s views on laughter and mirth would strike a

mediaeval mind as unusual.
pp. 170-1. [Et est actus-proponit] Dicitur.

The long text is more continuous
pp. 172-3 [Hii eciam—lingent] Animam.

After this passage, the scribe again copied where Rolle

returns to the subject of contemplation.
p. 175. [Comedi—uideam] Ieiunium.

This passage is in the first person, and describes Rolle’s
own practice with regard to eating and drinking; the scribe
always omitted such autobiographical passages, till his

abridgment at the end became merely careless.
pp. 177-9. [Si quis sancte—corporalem] Extiterunt.

This long autobiographical passage is one of those which
the scribe had (probably) previously copied,l as is also the
following :

pp. 187-91. [Cum infeliciter—incitemini] Deuotus.
pp. 191-2. [ubi est thesaurus—meus] O mors.

A first person passage.
pp. 195-6. [Quid enim—deuotus] cor.

The omission again ends when Rolle returns to the

subject of contemplation.
pp. 196-7. [Ego dixi—diuitibus] Caritas.
