68 LIFE OF NEWTON

The Ely register shews that Newton remained Fordham's
official till 30 June, 1389, but that another doctor of laws‚
Thomas Hetherset‚ had been appointed by 2 May, 1390.1
Before this, however, Newton had become the official of
his former patron, archbishop Arundel‚ at York,
and there is no evidence that he ever visited Cambridge
again, though he remained master 01 Peterhouse till 1397.
Before November, 1390, 116 received a canonry at York,
and on 6 November, 1390, 116 was appointed archbishop
Arundel‘s vicar general2 “nobis in remotis agentibus.”
Arundel's register 101· the subsequent period runs in his
name, 3and is mainly a record 01 institutions and inductions,
interspersed with a few wills, records 01 the reception of
vows of *chastity, and confirmations 01 elections to
the headships 01 religious houses. Nearly every
entry from 1390 to 1393 begins with Newton’s name.
A letter from archbishop Arundel, written “in hospicio
nostro apud Westmonasterium,'' 23 September, 1391,
addresses him as “Officiali nostro ac nobis in remotis
agentibus uicario generali in spiritualibus,” and shews that
at the date the office 01 vicar general was conferred at York
as a sort 01 enlargement of the office of official (which
Newton still held), in the archbishop’s prolonged absences.
This particular letter quotes another received from king
Richard‚ and in accordance with the royal request enjoins
