44 CURRENT PIETY

men hear what blessed Job said, etc. 3 and he launches forth
into texts against them.

Rolle has as hard things to say against the current piety
and current learning of his time, as against worldliness and
current fashions. “The wicked however, behave altogether
foolishly toward God ..... They enter the church, fill
the walls, beat their breasts, give forth deep sighs,—but
feigned ones clearly, because they reach the eyes of men,
not the ears of God. For when they are in church in body,
they are distracted in mind with those worldly goods which
they either have, or desire to have: and thus their heart is
far from God. . . . . Many give bread to the poor, and
perhaps clothes to the shivering, but when their alms are
done in mortal sin or for vain glory‚ or assuredly from those
things which they have unjustly gained, they are in nowise
pleasing to the Redeemer‚ but provoke the Judge to wrath.
. . . . For the devil owns many whom we reckon good.
For he has rnen who are almsgivers, chaste‚ humble, that is,
men who confess themselves sinners‚ wear sackcloth and
afflict themselves with penanc-es ..... For he has some
zealous in labour and instant in preaching: but there is no
doubt that he completely lacks those who are burning in
love, and ever thirsty to love God, and uneager for vanity.”l
In other passages Rolle complains of the insincerity and
half-heartedness of almsgivers, and the impossibility of
friendship· between the poor and the rich. “For some men
have so loved one another, that they have almost believed
that there was but one soul in them both. But he that is
poor in worldly goods, though he were rich in mind, is far
distant from such a love. For if a man must ever take, and
can rarely or never give, strange indeed would it be if he
had a friend whom he could trust in all things. Yet it
would profit a rich man to choose a holy poor man, even for
his special friend; for Christ said, ‘Make to yourselves
friends, that is, holy poor men, who are the friends of God.
