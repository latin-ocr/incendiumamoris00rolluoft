58 s ANSELM

Deum habeat, et vos quotidie, qualiter vivere debeatis, verbo
et exemplo doceat.'’ A passage in the middle of the letter
describes how every good or bad action proceeds from the
will, and this passage, beginning “Omnis actio laudabilis‚”
is found, unmarked, and embedded in Rolle's work, in all
the MSS. which contain this set of extracts from the
Incendium. I believe, however, that the confusion was not
due to Rolle himself, but to the scribe who produced the
series of extracts and the short form of the text, and who
was perhaps one of the Hampole nuns. (Vide infra, p. 89.)
This letter of Anselm to the recluses is one which might
have been found in the Hampole library, and been thus
accessible to Rolle himself. It is copied in another northern
MS.,1 the fly-leaves of which are formed of documents
relating to property in the county of York ε and among the
names found in these is “Robertus de Wyclef, rector
ecclesie de Ruddeby,’'—at one time, apparently, an owner
of the MS. This Robert de Wyclef or Wiclif is found
several times in close connexion with John Newton,
treasurer at York, and owner of an abridged text of the
Incendium at a very early date.2 The extract from the letter
here also begins “ Omnis actio laudabilis‚” but is continued
for several lines farther than when it is found in connexion
with the short text of the Incendium. The MS. itself
contains other works of Rolle, though not the Incendium,
which adds somewhat to the evidence that the earliest
copyists of Rolle found the epistle of Anselm in close
connexion with his work‚—perhaps copied by himself for
reference.

PSEUDO—DIONYSIUS.

There is not much trace in the Incendium of the influence
of the mystical writings of the pseudo-Dionysius, or only of
second-hand influence. john the Scot and Hugh of S.

and Scrope: and John Newton was appointed co-guardian with him, of a
young ward of Sir John Deepden (ef. Testamenta Eboracemia, i, 298,
