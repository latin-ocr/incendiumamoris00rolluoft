FITZ HUGH AND THE INCENDIUM 97

bequeathed to FitzHugh 1 “ for a remembrance '’ “ a book

. in which is contained the Incendium Amoris, which
Ri-chard the Hermit composed, and a small paper in which
is contained a homily on the (psalm) judica me Deus,
which Richard the Hermit composed and wrote.” If, as
is not directly stated, the Incendium Amoris were also
Rolle’s own manuscript, Newton may easily have
had access to it through his connexion with archbishop
Scrope.

FitzHugh took the first step· in the foundation of a Brigit-
tine monastery in 1406, when Henry IV employed him to
arrange the marriage of his daughter Philippa with Eric
XIII of Sweden. He accompanied the princess to Lund,
where the marriage took place, and afterwards on her visit to
the convent at Vadstena. “ In this year‚‘’ i.e. 1406, says the
Vadstena Diary, “was celebrated the marriage of the lord
King with the daughter of the King of England, Philippa
by name ..... And when the wedding was accomplished,
there came to Vadstena the lord Henry Ravensworth, a
noble knight of England, and before the assembled convent
he stated that he wished to found in England a monastery
of the rule of S. Saviour‚ and he gave the brothers his letters
concerning a place of this kind, and dower, and sought that
two brothers should be sent to England for the founding
of such a monastery, to which also the brothers assented‚
with heartfelt joy. This was done about the festival of
S. Andrew the Apostle.’' 2

This entry is confirmed by the actual “ letters ’' or
charter, dated 28 Nov. 1406, handed by FitzHugh to the
abbess of Vadstena. In them he states that 2——
