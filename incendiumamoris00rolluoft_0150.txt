120 FOUNDATION OF SION ABBEY

“trustyng also in the holynes and wisdoum of the.
Abbot of Saint Albones and of the Recluse of West-
mynstre‚ that saide it was lawfulle that he dede.1

“ Also, the earle of Warwicke was arraigned, and his
hood being taken off, and the appeale reade, as hee had
been some miserable old woman, confessed all things
contained in appeale, weeping, wayling, and howling, to
be done trayterously by him . . . . sorrowing that euer
hee had beene associate unto the appellants. Then the
King demanded of him by whom hee was allured to
joyne with them, and he answered, by Thomas, duke of
Gloucester, and the Abbot of S. Albones‚ and a Monk
recluse in Westminster.''2

Coming nearer to the date of the foundation of Sion, it
has been suggested that3 William Alnwick of the S. Albans
chronicler was the more famous recluse of Westminster‚ to
whom Henry resorted secretly after his father‘s death.
Another chronicler 4 states that “When the day of the
funeral had now ended in weeping and laments‚ and when
the shades of night covered the face of the earth, the tearful
prince, hidden by the darkness of the night, went secretly
to a certain recluse of perfect life at Westminster‚ and
revealing to him the secrets of his whole life, washed from
the font of true penitence, he received the antidote of
absolution against the poison he had earlier swallowed;
and, casting off the tunic of vices, he returned fairly clad in
the mantle of virtues.‘’ Henry V founded the houses of
Sheen and Sion as an expiation for the sins of his father‚——

1397 the VVestminster 1ecluse was acquainted with Thomas Beauchamp,
and that the S. Alban’s chronicler says Fishbourn atmacted royal notice
through his acquaintance with‘ ‘Elizabe'nh Beauchamp et Alianora Hulle.”
